<h3>Transcriber’s Notes</h3>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation, accents, spelling and punctuation remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>Anchors for footnotes 373, 379, 383, 391, 392, 394, 404, and 406 were
missing and have been added in appropriate places.
</p>

<p>The images in Arabic are of poor quality so the transcriptions should
be treated with caution.</p>

<p>The book contains several blank pages and long and multi page footnotes
hence there are gaps in, and variable spacing of, page numbers. Many
index entries refer directly to multi-page footnotes, where this is
clearly the case, the index link directs to the footnote.</p>

<p>The use of parentheses, especially in the footnotes, is rather wayward
and they have been paired wherever possible.

<p>Very much more abominable and repulsive still is
the habit of Irrumation<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> (<i>penem in os arrigere est
irrumare</i>—to erect the <i>penis</i> and insert it into the
mouth of another person) and the practice of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
<i>Fellator</i><a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> (<i>si quis vel labris vel lingua perfricandi
atque exsugendi officium peni praestat</i>—one who with
the lips or the tongue performs the office of rubbing
and sucking another’s <i>penis</i>). This the Greeks called
λεσβιάζειν (to follow the Lesbian mode), because
the vice was especially practised by the Lesbian
women, though in common with all others of the
sort it came originally from Asia. <i>Lucian</i> in his
<i>Pseudologista</i><a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, in which he severely criticizes the
the dissolute Timarchus, who had taken the expression
ἀποφρὰς (unmentionable) in ill part, says:
“By the gods, what should make you fly into a
passion, since it is a matter of common report that
you are a <i>Fellator</i> and a <i>Cunnilingus</i><a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>. Are you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
as much in the dark as to the meaning of these words
as you are about that of ἀποφρὰς (unmentionable)?
and do you take them for titles of honour? Or is
it that you are now accustomed to them, but not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
ἀποφρὰς, and so wish to erase it as something
unknown to you from the list of your Titles?
(ch. 28).—I am well aware what were your practices
in Palestine, in Egypt, in Phoenicia and Syria, as
well as in Hellas and Italy, and above all just now
in Ephesus, where you set the crown on your
extravagances, (ch. 11).—However you will never
persuade your fellow-citizens that they ought not to
regard you as the filthiest of all men, the very
refuse of the whole city. Now it may be you rely
on the belief of the generality in Syria, that you
have never been accused (there) of any guilt or vice.
But by Hercules! the city of Antioch looked on
at the whole history, when you carried off the young
man who came from Tarsus, and—but there, it would
not become me to go over such ground again. All
who were there know the facts and remember it all,
that time when they saw you sitting at his knees
(καὶ σὲ μὲν ἐς γόνυ συγκαθήμενον ἰδόντες), and
doing you know very well what to him, that is if
you have not utterly and entirely forgotten the whole
matter, (ch. 20).—But when they caught you lying
at the knees of the son of Oinopion the Cooper
(τοῦ μειρακίου ... ἐν γόνασι κείμενον—lying at the
knees of the stripling), what make you of that? Did
they not surely take you for a man of the sort to
be expected, when they saw you doing such a thing?
(ch. 28).—How, by Zeus! after such a deed, have
you the effrontery to give us the kiss of salutation?—Sooner
kiss an adder or a viper? The danger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
pain of the bite a Physician may yet remove, if
called in. But after your kiss and with such poison
on his lips who dare draw near to Temple or altar?
What god would listen to the suppliant? how many
vessels of holy water, how many lustrations, would
be needful? (ch. 24).—In Syria you are known as
ῥοδοδάφνη (rose-laurel)<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>; why, a man cannot explain
for very shame, great Athené!—But in Palestine as
φραγμὸς (the hedge)<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, on account of the prickles
of your beard, I suppose. In Egypt again as συνάγχη
(sore throat),—and this is a well known business.
It must have been a close thing with you not to be
choked, that time you came across the sailor of a
three-master, who fell upon you and stopped your
mouth for you (ὃς ἐμπεσὼν ἀπέφραξέ σοι τὸ
στόμα).”</p>

<p>This passage brings us next to a gloss of the
<i>Pseudo-Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>, on which <i>Naumann</i><a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, after laying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
down his view as to the <i>Morbus phoeniceus</i> (Purple
Plague),—a subject to be discussed presently,—goes
on to express himself thus: “However we must go
yet farther. In the above cited work of the Pseudo-Galen
is included an Index of words, <i>which with a
high degree of probability we may conclude to refer to
Venereal diseases, so far as known to the Ancients</i>
(loco citato, under word στρυμάργου, p. 142). We
read there that <i>Dioscorides</i> called στρυμάργους or
στομάργους (evil-mouthed) men in whom the longing
for sensual indulgence had risen to frenzy. Of similar
meaning to this would seem to be the expressions
μυοχάνη (<i>maxillarum hiatu insignis</i>—conspicuous for
the wide opening of the arm-pits) or μυσάχνη
(<i>meretrix</i>—prostitute), μῦσος (<i>facinus abominandum</i>—an
abominable act), σαράπους (crura ambulando
divaricans—straddling the legs in walking), and
γρυπαλώπηξ (from γρύπος <i>curvus</i>—curved, hooked,)
probably denoting the erection of the <i>penis</i>; at any
rate a dissolute man is called in Aristophanes
κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog). But most notable is the added
observation, to the effect that Erasistratus called such
persons ῥινοκολοῦροι (<i>i.e.</i> <i>qui mutilati naribus sunt</i>—men
who have been mutilated in their noses). Just
at the time of the Greek occupation of Egypt,
<i>Rhinocorura</i> or <i>Rhinocolura</i> was the name of a
wretched sort of “Botany Bay” situated at the
North-Eastern extremity of the country, lying in the
desert on the shores of the Mediterranean between
Gaza and Pelusium, and serving as a place of
residence for lepers (<i>Pliny</i>, Hist. Nat., Bk. V. ch. 4.
<i>Livy</i>, Hists. Bk. XXXV. ch. 11). Now if we bring
together all the information given here, and especially
if we consider the various shameful forms of
indulgence of the sexual impulse and the mutilation
of the nose that is connected with them, <i>there
cannot be much doubt left that these ancient and fragmentary
notices refer to Venereal evil</i>, whether in conjunction
with leprous affections or not.”</p>

<p>But to test the correctness of these explanations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
and conclusions, it will be necessary first of all to
quote the gloss itself in full: <em class="gesperrt">στρυμάργου.</em> οἶδε

σαράπους, γρυπαλώπηξ</em>· ἀλλὰ καὶ παρ’
Ἐρασιστράτῳ φησὶν ὁ <em class="gesperrt">ῥινοκολοῦρος</em>, that
is to say:—στρυμάργου: Dioscorides knows this
form also, not merely that of στομάργου, but this
too he regards not as a proper name, but says that
it signifies one who is madly set upon love-indulgences;
for that in Hippocrates as well many other
epithets of the same sort (which refer to the same
sort of vice) are mentioned, e.g. μυοχάνη, σαράπους,
γρυπαλώπηξ; also he says that in Erasistratus (the
expression) ῥινοκολοῦρος is found.</p>

<p>The reader sees in the first place that it is not
merely expressions peculiar to Dioscorides that are
here cited, as we might be led to suppose by
Naumann’s statement, but that they are every one
of them found, as we shall presently prove more
particularly, in <i>Hippocrates</i>, the ῥινοκολοῦρος of
Erasistratus of course excepted. <i>Dioscorides</i> mentions
them only in his commentary on the Second Book
of the “Epidemia”, when laying down the passages
to be cited immediately, and declares them not to
be proper names, but adjectives which all refer to
insane indulgence in the pleasures of love; accordingly
there can be no question here of <i>bodily disorders</i>,
let the words in themselves signify what they
will. Now if we examine into this more closely, we
shall find first of all that we must obviously read
στυμάργου in place of στρυμάργου, for not only
is this form given by the author of the gloss (under
στομάργου<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>), quoted on the preceding page, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the text also of Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> offers it in both
passages; whereas στρυμάργου gives no sort of
sense.</p>

<p>The word στυμάργος in fact is derived either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
from στῦμα<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>, the act of erecting the penis, and
and ἔργον (work), so signifying anyone who performs
the work of causing an erection of the penis,—or
else from στύω<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, I erect the penis, and μάργος<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
(mad), i. e. one who erects, uses, the penis in a
madly lascivious fashion, so an <i>Irrumator</i>, and with
this <i>Hesychius’</i> interpretation agrees: λεσβιάζειν,—πρὸς
ἀνδρὸς στόμα στύειν, (to lesbianize,—to erect
the penis in a man’s mouth). Στομάργος on the
other hand is formed by a combination of στόμα,
the mouth, and ἔργω or ἔργον (I work, work), a
word constantly used to express the employment of
the genital organs<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, in fact indulgence in love
generally, and signifies a man who performs the work
(of love) with the mouth, so a <i>Fellator</i><a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
since only the most abandoned lust, lust that has
really grown into a form of insanity, is capable of
undertaking such obscenities, the interpretation of
<i>Dioscorides</i> μανικῶς ἐπτοημένον περὶ τὰ ἀφροδίσια
(one that is insanely, madly, set on the pleasures of
love) is quite satisfactory, assuming a hesitation on
the part of the author to set forth the actual fact
more explicitly, especially as we have already proved
under the head of Paederastia<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> how unnatural
sexual desires were commonly regarded as a <i>Mania</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
or form of insanity. Even if we were not in a
position adequately to explain the rest of the words,
yet the phrase that comes next to them καὶ ἄλλα
πολλὰ κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον (and many others
of the same fashion) at once shows that they bear
the same signification as στύμαργος and στομάργος,
or at any rate that they must all alike refer to
unnatural satisfaction of the sexual impulse, for
τρόπος (fashion) is the very word particularly appropriated
to imply such-like practices, as we see
from the expressions Κρῆτα τρόπον, Ἑλληνικὸν
τρόπον<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, (Cretan fashion, Greek fashion) used to
indicate paederastia.</p>

<p>In relation to the word μυοχάνη the readings
differ greatly in the different MSS. of Galen. Franz
in his edition of the Glossaries to Hippocrates gives
μιοχάνης and μυοχάνης, while the Pseudo-Galen
explains it under the word μυοχάνη as ἐπίθετον
χασκούσης· εἰ δὲ <em class="gesperrt">μυριοχαύνη</em> γράφοιτο, ἡ ἐπὶ
μυρίοις ἂν εἴη χαυνουμένη (epithet applied to a
woman who gapes; now if <em class="gesperrt">μυριοχαύνη</em> were
read, it would mean “the woman who gapes wide
for ten thousand men”); besides, various readings are
found here,—μηοχάνη for μυοχάνη, also μιριοχάνη,
and μυιοχάνη for μυριοχαύνη. Erotian says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
μηριοχάνη ὄνομα γυναικὸς (Meriochané—a woman’s
name). In the text of Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> is found
Μυριοχαύνη, and the same form is given by the
editions of Galen<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. Inasmuch as χάνω and χαύνω
both have the same meaning of gaping wide, that
is with the mouth, it will practically make no difference
which we choose as the end of the word;
hence we have merely to consider the first part
μου- or μυριο-, all the rest of the forms being
obviously erroneous. If we read μουχάνη, we must
suppose it compounded of μύος and χάνη; but
inasmuch as μύος is merely a mistaken variant for
μῦσος, the word must be read μυσοχάνη. Μῦσος
in its turn we must derive either from μύζω, I
suck,—so a woman who sucks with open mouth<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>,
or from μυσιάω, I snort through the nose, particularly
in the act of coition, and consequently read
μυσιοχάνη, i.e. a woman who with mouth open
snorts through the nose, precisely what the fellatrix
undoubtedly does when at her work. This emendation
certainly makes better sense, and is all the more
likely from the fact that μυιοχάνη and μυριοχάνη
are also found as <i>variae lectiones</i>. Naumann would
seem desirous of reading μυσάχνη (μυζάχνη), in
which case it must be formed from μύζω, I suck,
and ἄχνη (froth), in fact the secretion that adheres
to the surface (of the <i>glans penis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>. This last reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
is all the more admissible, as according to Suidas<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
the word also occurs in Archilochus. Possibly however
we must regard as equally correct the form
μυριοχαύνη, and take it in the meaning given by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the Gloss, viz. <i>in millibus hians</i>! (gaping in a thousand
openings!), bearing in mind <i>Lampridius’</i><a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> expression
about Heliogabalus: <i>Quis enim ferre posset principem
per cuncta cava corporis libidinem recipientem!</i> (For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
who could endure a Prince <i>that welcomed lustful
pleasure by every opening of the body</i>!)</p>

<p>The readings also vary as to σαράπους (turning
out the feet); <i>Franz</i> gives ἀγράπους and ἀράπους;
in the text of Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> on the other hand, as
well in the Commentary of Galen it appears as
ἡ Σεραπὶς, the latter also giving it in the genitive—τῆς
Σεράπιδος. But inasmuch as the name of the
goddess occurs sometimes as Σέραπις, sometimes
as Σάραπις;, and as the genitive ending—πιδος
easily admits of change into—πόδος, it may very
likely be that after all Σαράπους stood originally
in Hippocrates’text. The author of the Gloss (loco
citato p. 136.) explains the word by ἡ διασεσηρότας
καὶ διεστῶτας ἔχουσα τοὺς δακτύλους τῶν ποδῶν
that is, a woman who has the toes drawn apart and
separated. But how are we to bring this explanation
into agreement with the κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον,
(after the same fashion), that is to say, with one of
the modes of Love that are under discussion? Think
of the <i>fellator</i> or <i>fellatrix</i>, we are told, cowering
down (ἐν γόνασι,—on the knees) according to
<i>Lucian’s</i> picture (p. 229 above), and you will see
the stress of the body’s weight must always fall on
the front part of the foot, and to widen the point
of support he is instinctively compelled to spread
the toes. Well! but who can fail to see how very
forced such an explanation is? still we do not in
the least know how we are to deal with it further.
Of course we might leave the author of the Gloss
his interpretation and proceed to look about for
another of our own, though we have in many cases
to confess the fact that our investigations undertaken
with this end in view have not exactly led to any
definite results. With the reading Σεραπίς we really
do not know how to deal. Perhaps the common
representation, or else some particular quality, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
goddess so named gave occasion for a comparison
which we now fail to understand, one that might
possibly suggest an explanation of the <i>Harpocratem
reddere</i> (to recall Harpocrates) of Catullus (69.)
implying <i>irrumare</i><a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>. Whether the reader will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
within his purview the Σεραφίμ, ἐμπρηστάς· ἔμπυρα
στόματα· ἢ θερμαίνοντας (Seraphim: kindlers; fiery
mouths: or, making hot) of <i>Suidas’</i> Lexicon, we
must leave to him; in that case <i>Martial’s</i> (II. 28.)
<i>calda Vetustinae nec tibi bucca placet</i> (nor does
Vetustina’s hot mouth please you) might afford an
analogy. Proceeding to consider σαράπους, we find
<i>Hesychius</i> has σαραπίους, which he explains by
μαινίδας (mad-women), and <i>Dioscorides</i> is at one
with him in regarding the vice as something done
μανικῶς (madly). In <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> (I. 4.) we
read Pittacus was called: σαράποδα καὶ σάραπον
διὰ τὸ πλατύπουν εἶναι καὶ ἐπισύρειν τὼ πόδε.
(<i>turning out the feet</i>, because of his being flat-footed
and trailing his two feet). It would be hardly credible
to suppose that the author of the Gloss borrowed
his explanation cited just above from Diogenes
Laertius or Suidas, in whom the passage occurs as
well. Further, the MSS. of Diogenes give also
συράπους, a word found several times in the sense
of “to stand with legs apart,” and Naumann too
must have understood this in our passage, for he
gives as his rendering <i>crura ambulando divaricans</i>
(straddling the legs in walking). Now leaving altogether
out of the question the fact that the feminine
form is found in Hippocrates, and assuming the
word to be used of men, it might perfectly well
signify the <i>irrumator</i>, who takes the <i>fellator</i> between
his opened thighs<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>, a posture that was generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
regarded as obscene<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>. Indeed if we think of the <i>fellator</i>
as sitting on the ground at his work, the word of course
can be equally well used of a woman, or <i>fellatrix</i>.</p>

<p>As to γρυπαλώπηξ we read in <i>Hippocrates</i> (loco
citato p. 629.) as follows: “Satyrus in Thasos bore
the nick-name of γρυπαλώπηξ; when about twenty
five he suffered from frequent nightly pollutions,
and yet by day the same happened him even more
constantly. When he was thirty years of age, he
got consumption and died.” From this we see at
once the question is of a dissolute man, who in
consequence of his vicious practises had brought on
such a weakness of the genitals, that he suffered
from continual evacuation of seed, the result being
that eventually Phthisis was set up, to which he
succumbed. As variations of reading we find noted
in <i>Franz’s</i> Gloss ῥυπαλώπηξ and τρυπαλάπηξ;
Schneider in his Lexicon renders γρυπαλώπηξ by
“griffin-fox”, so he must evidently have derived it
from γρύψ (a griffin) and ἀλώπηξ (a fox). The
Ancients depict the fox as a cunning, crafty animal
and assign several characteristics as marking his
behaviour that must probably be taken into consideration
in the present connection,—and particularly
the way he seizes and kills the hedge-hog. According
to <i>Aelian</i><a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> he endeavours to throw the creature on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
its back, so that its mouth comes uppermost, and
then discharges its urine into it. Now in order to
signify the <i>irrumator</i>, the Ancients really could hardly
have invented a better expression, when they, firmly
convinced of course of the fact as stated, compared
him to a fox. But what is a γρυπαλώπηξ? <i>Hesychius</i>
under the word γρυπός (hooked, curved) explains it
as τὰ ἔξω τοῦ στόματος καμπυλόῤῥις· ὁ ἐπικαμπῆ
τὴν ῥῖνα ἔχων. (hook-nosed outside the mouth; a
man having his nose bent down). <i>Suidas</i> again says
γρυπός, ὁ καμπυλόῤῥιν (γρυπός,—a hook-nosed
man); so a man with a nose bent down crooked
over the mouth. Now this we might very well
understand as applying to the <i>fellator</i>, inasmuch as
his nose, when the <i>irrumator</i> presses down hard on
him, as the sailor does to <i>Timarchus</i> (p. 230 above),
is of necessity compressed and bent down towards
the mouth; γρυπαλώπηξ would according to this
be a man who, like Timarchus in <i>Lucian</i>, is at once
an <i>irrumator</i> and a <i>fellator</i>. Of yet another word,
κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog) cited by Naumann, we propose
to speak under the head of the <i>Cunnilingue</i>, who
as we shall see might likewise be signified by the
expression.</p>

<p>Finally, as to ῥινοκολοῦρος (nose-docked), for
which the MSS. also have ῥινοκλοῦρος, it is certainly
the case that in Antiquity the man who
practised vice with strange women (<i>Moechus</i>,—adulterer)
had his nose cut off<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>, and as <i>Moechus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
equally signifies the <i>fellator</i><a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>, the latter also may
very well have been obliged to forfeit his nose.
Following this hint, it would be quite legitimate to
suppose the punishment to have been put for the
vice, and a <i>fellator</i> called ῥινοκολοῦρος (nose-docked)
on this ground; in the same way as the loss of the
nose might be looked upon as a consequence of
vice, and anyone seeing a man in this case would
at once think of his dissolute past life, as indeed
frequently happens at the present day amongst
ourselves.</p>

<p>The town of Rhinocolurus,—and its history is
more than problematical,—would seem to have nothing
whatever to do with the question. The passages
from <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Livy</i> which Naumann quotes give
absolutely nothing beyond the name; and the mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
existence of the name <i>Diodorus</i><a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> certifies, in his
story of how Actisanes proceeded against the Robbers
in a way of his own: “He did not wish to put the
guilty to death, nor yet to leave them unpunished.
So he had the accused brought up out of the whole
country and inquired into each case most scrupulously;
such as were found to be guilty all had their
noses cut off by his orders, and were banished to
the most remote spot in the Desert. The town he
founded for them there received in remembrance of
the punishment inflicted on its inhabitants the name
of Rhinocolura. It lies on the borders of Egypt
and Syria, not far from the sea-shore that borders
the desert in that region, and displays an almost
complete absence of all requisites for comfortable
habitation. For the surrounding district possesses
a soil thoroughly saturated with salt, while inside
the town very little water is to be found and that
positively tainted and of quite a bitter taste.”
Diodorus relates further that these Colonists lived
by catching quails; but of <i>Leprosy</i> there is no mention
either here or in Strabo or Seneca, so that Naumann’s
statement to the effect that it served as a dwelling-place
for Lepers lacks entirely, up to the present
and at any rate so far as we know, any historical
foundation, though the character of the place is not
against such a hypothesis. Nor is any question
raised in any author as to the vicious life of the
inhabitants of Rhinocolura,—in fact in later times
it was actually famous for the number of its <i>men
of piety</i><a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Though the explanation of ῥινοκολοῦρος given
just now might very well at a pinch be regarded as
satisfactory, still we think it hardly answers sufficiently
well to the κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον (after
the same fashion), while the variant ῥινοκλοῦρος
seems to point to ῥιναύλουρος or ῥιναύλουρις as
the true reading. In <i>Tatian</i> (Orat. ad Graecos p. 83.)
in fact we read: <em class="gesperrt">ῥιναυλοῦσι</em> τὰ αἰσχρά, κινοῦνται
δὲ κινήσεις ἃς οὐκ ἐχρῆν, καὶ τοὺς ὄπως δεῖ
μοιχεύειν ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς σοφιστεύοντας αἱ θυγατέρες
ὑμῶν καὶ οἱ παῖδες θεωροῦσι. (They flute
their obscenities through the nose, and make movements
that in decency they should not make, while
actors who teach on the stage the whole art of how
to debauch a woman are the spectacle your daughters
and your boys gaze at.) The Scholiast observes on
this ῥινοκτυποῦσιν, οἱονεὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῖς ῥώδωσι,
συνέλκοντες ποιὸν ἦχον ἐπὶ καταγέλωτι ἀποτελοῦσι,
(they make a noise with the nose, a sort of
breathing with the nostrils; by drawing in these
they produce a certain sound by way of mockery),
and in <i>Lucian</i>, Lexiphanes ch. 19., we find ἔοικα
δὲ καὶ ῥιναυστῆσειν, (and I am like to go nose-playing),
of which the Scholiast gives the following
explanation: ἀντὶ τοῦ ταῖς ῥισὶ καταυλῆσαι, ἐποίουν
γὰρ τοῦτο <em class="gesperrt">ῥιναυλοῦντες</em>, ἤτοι διὰ τῶν ῥινῶν
ψοφοῦντες ἐπὶ διασυρμῷ τινῶν καὶ χλεύῃ. (put
instead of <i>fluting with the nostrils</i>; for they used to
do this when they nose-fluted, or in other words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
made a noise with the nostrils by way of mocking
people and joking). Now if we take ῥιναυλεῖν (to
nose-flute) in these passages,—and all this confirms
what has been previously said (above p. 144.) on
the word ῥέγχειν (to snort) in the Speech of Dio
Chrysostom,—for <i>fistulam canere per nares</i>, <i>to play the
flute with the nose</i>, and at the same time remember
that <i>Eustathius</i> (as was noted above, p. 236. Note 2.)
derived ἀπομύζουρις and μύζουρις from μυζᾶν-οὐράν
(οὐρά,—the tail, the penis), the Greeks would
seem to have said ῥιναυλεῖν-οὐράν, <i>penem pro fistula
canere</i>, (to play on the penis instead of a flute),
and we should have the adjective or substantive
ῥιναύλουρις, <i>qui penem pro fistula canit per nares</i>,
(one who plays on the penis instead of a flute with
the nostrils), which admirably expresses not only the
action of the <i>fellator</i>, but also the music he makes
to accompany it, as he is compelled to snort, drawing
his breath heavily through the nose.</p>

<p>Which explanation the reader will choose, we must
really leave to him, for interpretations of words of
this sort can never be brought to the absolute test
of evidence, inasmuch as nick-names as a rule take
their origin only too often in external circumstances.
Still this much we think we may pronounce with
certainty, that the words of the Gloss have to do
simply <i>de rebus venereis</i>, with matters of love, and
not with Venereal complaints, and thus Naumann’s
propositions<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> at least are devoid of foundation.
Perhaps it may be possible by means of a comparison
of the licentious representations on old
Vases, of which the late <i>Hofrath</i> Böttiger would
seem to have possessed a choice collection, and
some examples of which are preserved also at Berlin,
in connection with one or other of the words given
in the Gloss, as generally with the embodiments in
Art of the <i>Venus ebria</i> (drunken Venus), to afford a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
better explanation, one that may indeed be of no
particular value to the student of Antiquity pure and
simple, but nevertheless is indispensable to the
Physician for the correct understanding of sundry
diseases of the Ancients, or at any rate one sufficient
to avoid incorrect assertions and false conclusions,
and to refute such.</p>

<p>We are not in a position to give a systematic
history of the spread of the vice of the <i>fellator</i> and
<i>irrumator</i>; but at any rate this much is certain that
in Imperial times the Vice was most widely indulged
in, as the Epigrams of <i>Martial</i>, and what <i>Suetonius</i>
relates in his Life of Tiberius (chs. 44, 45.) sufficiently
bear witness.</p>


<h4><a name="Diseases_of_the_Fellator" id="Diseases_of_the_Fellator">Diseases of the Fellator.</a><br />

<small>§ 22.</small></h4>

<p>Now to pass on to the medical point of view, no
one presumably will deny that the mouth of the
<i>fellator</i> must necessarily be exposed to various complaints
as a consequence of his Vice. Nevertheless
there prevails universally, so far as our studies up to the
present have enabled us to judge, complete silence
among the Physicians of Antiquity as to the practice of
λεσβιάζειν (to Lesbianize, to practise <i>fellation</i>) as a
cause occasioning morbid affections of the mouth
and the contiguous parts. This is the more surprising,
as we find that non-professional Writers are
not entirely unacquainted with such effects, as we
shall show directly. For our purpose this silence is
doubly unfortunate, depriving us as it does of all
means of submitting such affections of the mouth as
are described by Physicians to any proper appreciation
in regard to their ætiological relationships,—an
appreciation that in any case must naturally have
been in view of our knowledge of the vice of the
<i>fellator</i> one of extreme difficulty. The difficulty is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
this: <i>fellator</i> and <i>fellatrix</i>, equally with the <i>Cunnilingue</i>,
the fornicater and fornicatrix, were liable to suffer
from ulcers of the throat, for example, as a result
of their peculiar vice, but in the former case these
ulcers were primary, in the latter secondary,—now
how is an inquirer to discover any diagnostic sign
here, whereby to distinguish the one class from the
other? Yet all the while, certainty on this point is
of the very highest importance in view of the question
as to the existence of Venereal disease in Antiquity,
the chief argument always alleged against accepting
the fact of such existence being the absence of
secondary symptoms such as are nowadays commonly
met with, especially about the throat<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that not one, so far as we know,
of the authors who have studied the history of
Venereal Disease makes any mention of this circumstance;
neither do the Pathologists ever bring
forward the vice of the <i>fellator</i> as an ætiological
factor. <i>Clossius</i><a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> it is true speaks of <i>Irrumatio</i>,
relying on <i>Perenotti di Cigliano</i> and <i>Fabre</i>; but these
last are really speaking of the <i>Cunnilingue</i>, not of
the <i>fellator</i>. Probably they are of Erasmus’opinion:
λείχαζειν <i>ni fallor tale quiddam est Graecis, quale
fellare Latinis. Nam vox etiamnum manet, tametsi
rem iam olim e medio sublatam arbritor.</i> (λειχάζειν—to
practise licking,—if I am not mistaken, is a similar
practice with the Greeks to that of <i>fellation</i> with the
Romans. The word indeed still remains, but the
thing I believe to have long since entirely disappeared).
On this however <i>Forberg</i> (loco citato p. 304.)
very justly adds: <i>Vereor ut vere: certe audio, ne ab
nunc hominum quidem moribus plane abhorrere id
schematis, quid viderint ii, quibus magnas urbes adire
licet.</i> (I fear this is not true: at any rate I am told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
this sort of practice is not entirely repugnant to the
habits of some men even of our own day, to judge
by what those see who have the opportunity of
visiting large cities). How many primary ulcers of the
throat, especially in the case of common Prostitutes,
may have been mistaken for secondary ones, and
have been treated accordingly, in fact are treated so
still, without the Physician having a suspicion of
how they were actually incurred! But what the
Physicians of our own times are ignorant of, though
familiar enough to many of the Laity, this knowledge
we cannot reasonably demand from the Physicians
of Antiquity. Yet supposing they did actually possess
this knowledge, it was very excusable if they looked
at what lay nearest before their eyes and regarded
all throat ulcers as being primary,—in just the same
way as any Practitioner of to-day finds it excusable
in a Colleague that he thinks only of secondary
ulcers, inasmuch as what in Ancient times happened
very commonly is practised at the present day at
any rate much less frequently. Consequently the
absence of mention on the part of the old Physicians
of secondary ulcers of the throat in connection with
complaints of the genital organs cannot be considered
as any sort of proof of their non-existence.</p>

<p>Among the maladies to which the <i>fellator</i> was
exposed, we have in the first place to reckon the
<i>foul smell from the mouth</i><a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>, which is mentioned as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
especially prevalent among the Romans. The Physicians
as a rule derived it, if no local symptoms,
of ulcers, etc., were apparent, from some fault of the
stomach<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>,—an instance surely where the Laity were
cleverer than the Profession! The sympathy between
the mouth and the genitals and anus makes it
evident why at the present day we notice, particularly
in immoral women, an evil smell from the mouth,
which they endeavour to conceal by chewing burned
coffee and the like. No doubt this was the case in
Antiquity<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> as well, so we are by no means justified
in attributing every instance of foul breath in harlots
and cinaedi to the practice of <i>fellation</i>.</p>

<p>Yet another consequence of <i>fellation</i> was <i>pain in
the mouth</i> (στομαλγία, mouth-ache; only we must
remember as to this that <i>Pollux</i>, Onomast. III.
7. 69., cites ἀλγεῖν,—to suffer pain, as a synonym
of <i>to love</i>), <i>tongue-ache</i> (γλωσσαλγία<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>) and <i>toothache</i><a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>,
and generally pains of the palate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
throat, rendering voice and speech indistinct. Hence
<i>Martial</i> says<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Qui recitat lana fauces et colla revinctus,</div>
  <div class="verse">Hic se posse loqui, posse <em class="gesperrt">tacere</em> negat.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(The man who reads aloud his works, his throat and
neck bound about with wool, declares he cannot
speak, yet cannot hold his tongue).</p>

<p>But the evil by no means stopped here; there
more often occurred as the result of the habit of
<i>fellation</i> acute no less than chronic inflammations of
the palate (sore throats, quinseys). In the passage
quoted a little above from <i>Lucian’s</i> Pseudologistae,
it is said of Timarchus: “In Egypt on the other
hand they called you συνάγχη (sore throat),—as
everybody knows.” In explanation <i>Lucian</i> adds:
“It must have been a close thing with you not to
be choked, that time you came across the sailor of
a three-master, who fell upon you and stopped your
mouth for you.” Without in any way detracting
from the importance of what we are told here, it
still appears to us, on full consideration, that Timarchus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
was not merely a <i>fellator</i>, but an <i>irrumator</i> as well,
and this is the more probable as he no doubt
acquired this nickname, because he, <i>bene vasatus</i>
(well provided with a big <i>member</i>), frequently brought
on sore throat, that is to say in those who served
him as <i>fellators</i>!</p>

<p>Moreover this reveals to us the real meaning of
a passage of <i>Aretaeus</i>, one that has often been quoted
before as connected with Venereal disease. This
occurs in the 9th Chapter of the Book<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>, which
would certainly seem to admit only of a direct
application; still we are convinced that much of the
pathological description of sore throat (Ch. 7.) and
many symptoms of the complaints of the uvula
(Ch. 8.) owe their origin to <i>fellation</i>. Undoubtedly
we have nowadays much fewer occasions to note
affections of the uvula, which were of very common
occurrence among the Ancients<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>, as is shown by
their own accounts,—a circumstance hardly to be
wondered at if we consider the particulars told us
about Timarchus. <i>Aretaeus</i> in Ch. 9. makes a distinction
between κίων (pillar, uvula) or columella
(little pillar, uvula), when the whole uvula is inflamed
and swollen, σταφυλὴ or uva (bunch of grapes),
when only the lower part is affected, and ἰμάντιον
(little strap), when the palatal membrane is attacked.
“Κίων”, he goes on, “occurs most frequently with
old men, σταφυλὴ with young men and such as are
in the prime of life, affection of the palatal membranes
(τὰ ὑμενώδεα) in those who are at the age of
puberty and in boys.” The ninth Chapter runs as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>


<h4>Of Ulcers of the Throat.</h4>

<p>Ulcers arising in the throat of a benignant and
harmless nature are common, the malignant and
dangerous rare. Benignant ulcers of the sort are
clean, of slight extent and superficial, neither inflamed
nor painful. The malignant on the contrary are
broad, hollow, lardaceous, with a white, livid, or
black covering. These ulcers are known as <i>aphthae</i>.
But if the covering is very tough, then the malady
is an eschar, and is so called. At the edge of the
eschar are set up an intense redness, inflammation
and a congested state of the veins, as in <i>anthrax</i>
(carbuncle, malignant pustule), while small, distinct
and unconnected, elevations of the mucous membrane
appear, which are continually uniting with fresh ones
that successively follow, and so an extensive ulcer
is established. If this extends from the outer mouth
too far inwards, in fact once it has attacked the
uvula and relaxed it, the disease spreads over the
tongue, gums and lips, while the teeth become loose
and blackened. Further the inflammation attacks
the throat. Patients so affected die in a few days
after the inflammation and fever are set up, of the
evil odour and of hunger; the ulcer propagates itself
by way of the wind-pipe to the chest, so that very
likely suffocation supervenes the same day. For
lungs and heart can tolerate neither so foul an odour
nor the ulcers themselves nor the ichor (puriform,
septic matter) coming from them, but cough and
difficulty of breathing supervene. Origin of this
affection of the throat is the swallowing of cold,
pungent, hot, sour, or strongly astringent, substances.
Now these parts serve the chest on behalf of the
voice and the breathing, as also the abdomen for
sifting the nutriment, and the stomach for swallowing
food. But when these inward parts, viz. abdomen,
stomach and chest, are attacked by a disease, the
disease is in turn conveyed and carried to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
œsophagus, the tonsils and neighbouring regions.</p>

<p>Children up to the age of puberty suffer most in
this way, for children have the very greatest and
most marked desire for coolness, because with them
the natural heat is at its greatest; the longing for
foods of various sorts and cold beverages is boundless;
while they shout loudly both in quarrel and
at play. This is equally true of girls up to the
commencement of menstruation.</p>

<p>With regard to locality, <i>Egypt</i> gives most numerous
examples of the disease, for this country has at once
a dry air to breathe, and many sorts of comestibles,—roots,
herbs, garden vegetables, pungent seeds; while
the drink is either thick, being Nile water, or artificially
made pungent with barley or with grape-skins.
In <i>Syria</i> the disease is also found, especially
in Coelesyria. For this reason the ulcers in question
are known as <i>Egyptian</i> or <i>Syrian</i> ulcers.</p>

<p>The mode and fashion in which death occurs in
these cases is deplorable. The pain is a cutting
and burning pain, as in anthrax (carbuncle, malignant
pustule), the breath foul-smelling, the patient exhaling
an intensely offensive breath, and re-inhaling into
the chest another no less so. Patients are so loathsome
to themselves they cannot tolerate their own
smell; the face is pale or livid, the temperature
excessively high, the thirst as distressing as in fever.
Yet they reject drink when offered from dread of
the pain of swallowing; for they undergo great
agony both by the compression of the palate and
by the return of the liquid through the nose. No
sooner have they lain down than they spring up again;
then finding they cannot bear an upright posture,
no sooner have they sat down than they are forced
by their agony to lie back once more. Most commonly
they move about in an upright attitude. For
as they are unable to sleep, they avoid all rest, as
though they were fain to drive away one torture
with another. Inhalation is deep, for they long for
fresh air to cool themselves; exhalation on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
contrary short and hurried, for the ulcers already
burning like fire are heated yet further by contact
of the feverish breath as it streams out. Hoarseness
comes on, and loss of voice, and this goes on continuously
increasing, until suddenly coming to the
end of their resistance they give up the ghost.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the portion of the work devoted to Therapeutics
(Bk. I. ch. 9.), which bears the title: Θεραπεία τῶν
κατὰ τὴν φαρύγγα λοιμικῶν παθῶν, (Pestilential
Affections of the Throat Regions, their Curative
Treatment), caustics are especially recommended, as
the actual cautery cannot be employed, and finally
we read: “In some cases the uvula is destroyed
right back to the bones of the palate, and the throat
to the root of the tongue and the epiglottis, and in
consequence of this destruction they can get down
neither solid food nor liquid, for liquids return through
the nose, and so the patient dies of hunger.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now if we examine these statements more closely,
we cannot first of all help wondering how the
ætiological factors named by <i>Aretaeus</i> could possibly
be regarded by him as sufficient to account for such
dangerous ulcerations,—ulcerations which he himself
even calls λοιμώδεα (of pestilential character), though
of course they are perfectly adequate to explain
simple ulcers of the throat. Indulgence in pungent
comestibles and beverages is as little adequate to
cause such symptoms as are the shouting and greediness
of children, not to mention the fact that these
are in no way peculiar to Egypt or Syria. The
whole account shows us clearly that while <i>Aretaeus</i>
was well acquainted with the forms the disease took,
the ætiological factors were obscure to him and it
was merely in a spirit of ill-timed speculation he subjoined
them, proving once more how right <i>Appuleius</i>
was when he exclaims: <i>Dii boni! Quam facilis,
<em class="gesperrt">licet non artifici medico</em>, cuivis tamen docto
Venereae cupidinis comprehensio.</i> (Great gods! how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
easy it is for any educated man, <i>always excepting
a medical practitioner</i>, to understand the passion
of love).</p>

<p>We have already more than once in the course
of these investigations proved how Egypt and Syria
must be regarded as the nursery of licentiousness in
Antiquity, and the passage quoted from <i>Lucian</i>
(above p. 229.) directly establishes the fact for us;
again, a little further on (p. 240. Note I.) it was
mentioned how boys particularly, (but also young
girls), were used and specially trained as <i>fellators</i>.
Hence <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> wishes he had a boy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Niliacis primum puer is nascatur in oris:</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(In the first place my boy must be born on the banks
of Nile: no other land can produce more finished
wickedness). From all this, as well as from a comparison
of the passage in Lucian, we believe we are
amply justified in concluding that Aretaeus’ulcers
of the throat, these Αἰγύπτια καὶ Συριακὰ ἕλκεα
(Egyptian and Syrian sores) were not unfrequently
a consequence of <i>fellation</i><a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>. That this should be
so is readily intelligible, when we consider the
liability to corruption and the acrid quality of
secretions from the <i>glans penis</i> in hot countries.
Again the βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα (Bubastic sores), which
<i>Salmasius</i> cites from <i>Aëtius</i><a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> as being identical with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the Egyptian and Syrian ulcers, find a satisfactory
explanation on this hypothesis, for <i>Herodotus</i><a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> tells
us in his time of the licentious worship of Bubastis,
daughter of Isis, at Bubastos. In this expression
(βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα) the malady is named from one
particular place, where it was probably specially
prevalent, whereas in Aretaeus it is spoken of as
general throughout the country.</p>

<p>In this connection we must not pass over the fact
that Casaubon commenting on the passage of Persius
(V. 187.) to be quoted directly is inclined to regard
the ἕλκεα Συριακὰ (Syrian sores) as a punishment
of the Dea Syra (Syrian goddess). In this he relies
on a passage of <i>Plutarch</i><a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that runs to this effect:
“But of the Syrian goddess the superstitious believe
that, if a man eat a sprat or anchovy, the goddess consumes
his shin-bones, fills his body full of sores, melts
down his liver.” The legend must at any rate be
of great antiquity, for we meet with it in <i>Menander</i>,
in a fragment which <i>Porphyrius</i><a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
preserved,—in which however swelling of the belly and the feet
is in question. To this also would seem to refer
what <i>Persius</i> (loco citato) says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Hinc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos,</div>
  <div class="verse">Incussere <em class="gesperrt">Deos inflantes corpora</em>, si non</div>
  <div class="verse">Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Then the tall Galli, and the one-eyed priestess with
her sacred rattle, instil terror of <i>the gods that make
men’s bodies swell</i>, unless three times at dawn you
have eaten the prescribed head of garlic). True we
cannot from the passage of Plutarch directly conclude
that ulcers of the throat also were ascribed to the
anger of the Syrian goddess in consequence of
indulgence in a fish diet; rather should we expect
what is said to apply primarily to external skin-ulcers,
occurring on other parts, as just on the shin-bone.
Still we shall be quite justified in making the
reference general, more particularly as liver-complaint
is also ascribed to the goddess’s interference, and
we shall see that in Antiquity the cause of all ulcers
was supposed to lie in some fault of the liver. Now
as the fish had necessarily to be put into the mouth
to be swallowed, and as it was always supposed the
punishment of the goddess followed immediately on
the offence, and affected the immediately active
part, throat-ulcers might very naturally be taken to
be a result of such punishment. This again only
further confirms our explanation just above to the
effect that ulcers of the throat were a consequence
resulting from vicious indulgence. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Temple-service of the Dea Syra was of course connected
with every sort of licentious practice.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration this marked prevalence
of <i>Corrosion of the Shin-bones</i>, we might argue with
considerable probability that it pointed to the existence
of a disease of the bones following as a result
of vicious indulgence. On the other hand the
observation that the precise time the body became
covered with ulceration was after indulgence in fish-eating
cannot help being of weight in connection
with the doctrine of Leprosy; for to the present day
we note as very frequent among peoples whose
chief nutriment is fish various forms of Leprosy.
And again, we may very likely see in this prohibition
of a fish diet, which is also mentioned by <i>Athenaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>,
a sanitary regulation justified by experience as
necessary in Syria, where skin-diseases and ulcerations
were so common.</p>

<p>But not alone in Egypt and Syria did <i>fellation</i>
lead to suchlike unhappy results; we find the same
to have been the case at Rome, as is proved by
the following passage of <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>, a passage that
has hitherto been completely overlooked in this
connection, but which is none the less of great
importance:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Indignas premeret pestis cum tabida fauces</em></div>

</div></div></div>

<p>(<i>When corrupting disease began to sorely afflict his
unworthy throat and black contagion was creeping to
his very face</i>, Festus, himself with dry cheeks, comforted
his weeping friends, and determined to seek
the pools of Styx. But still he never disgraced his
dutiful lips with darkling poison, nor brought on a
painful, miserable end by slow hunger; nay! rather
by a Roman death he completed his holy life, and
dismissed his soul the nobler way. Such a death
fame may well exalt above great Cato’s end; Caesar
was his friend).</p>

<p>The words <i>indignae fauces</i> (unworthy throat) obviously
point to the practice of <i>fellation</i>, whereby he
had brought on himself the <i>pestis tabida</i> and <i>atra
lues</i>, (corrupting disease, black contagion), and so we
have here a clear statement of the cause by one
<i>doctus venereae cupidinis</i> (learned in the passion of
love), which cause was quite unknown to the <i>artifex
medicus</i> (medical practitioner). The <i>pia ora</i> (dutiful
lips) are therefore to be taken merely ironically, as
also the <i>sancta vita</i> (holy life). Even the Cinaedus,
as well as the maidens who prostitute themselves in
honour of Astarté, are invariably, as we have seen,
described in the Old Testament as <i>sanctus</i> (holy),
and we read e. g. in Job. Ch. XXXV. 14., of a
good-for-nothing, how he will die like such a <i>sanctus</i>.
It was precisely this signification of <i>sanctus</i> that led
us to the idea of taking the throat affection for a
secondary consequence of paederastia, especially if
we understand a <i>double entendre</i> to underlie the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
words <i>huius Caesar amicus erat</i> (Caesar was his
friend). The Commentators it is true take them
merely as said by way of contrast with the death
of Cato of Utica, who was forced by Caesar’s enmity
to take his own life, and as implying this was not
the case with Festus, consequently that his suicide
is so much the more remarkable<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>. However it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
doubtful which Caesar is meant, whether the word
is merely a Title or a proper name. In the second—and
certainly this at first appeared to us to be
the more likely,—view we were of course bound
then to turn our attention to his character for
dissoluteness. However as both <i>Catullus</i><a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and
<i>Suetonius</i><a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> represent him merely as a <i>Cinaedus</i> in
regard to the male sex, if that is to say we subscribe
to the accepted opinion, we afterwards came to the
conclusion it was rather the <i>Emperor</i> generally that
is spoken of here, and consequently that any other
Emperor, e. g. Tiberius, or Nero, or another, might
be intended. It is true that if <i>pathicus</i> (pathic) and
<i>omnium virorum mulier</i> (wife of all men) are taken
in a wider sense, there would be nothing to make
the supposition impossible that Julius Caesar is
pointed at. Only that perhaps another passage of
<i>Martial</i> would seem to go against this, a passage
where he seeks to excuse the several excesses and
vices of a certain Gaurus by instancing an exalted
personage as patronizing each of them, and says
finally (Bk. II. 89.):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Quod fellas; vitium dic mihi cuius habes?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(But for your <i>fellation</i>: tell me whose vice you follow
in this?) Still against the <i>cinaedus</i> view the words
<i>indignae fauces</i> (unworthy throat) speak clearly.
Probably in this connection the following passage of
<i>Martial</i> should also come in,—where the Poet says
of his servant (Bk. I. Epigr. 102.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Destituit primos virides Demetrius annos:</div>

<p>(Demetrius left us in the first years of his bloom;

that had fastened upon him, and remitted all my
master’s rights for the sick lad,—who indeed well
deserved to win recovery at my hands. On his
death-bed he recognized what I had done for him,
and called me his <i>master</i>, though so soon to go forth

<p>Was this <i>famulus</i> (house-slave) the same person as
the <i>puer</i> (boy, slave), who is mentioned by <i>Martial</i>,
bk. XI. 95.?</p>

<p>That not boys only, but girls too, had to suffer
in this way among the Romans, and lost their lives
from the complaint in question, is shown, we think,
by the following Epigram of <i>Martial</i>, Bk. XI.

disease infected her very kisses; and her lips were
half gone when they were consigned to the grim
pyre. If death must needs have come to her with
a flight so swift, at least he should have taken another
way. Death so hasted to close the issue of her
persuasive voice, that her tongue might not have
time to bend the cruel goddesses to mercy).</p>

<p>Besides the passages quoted, there are several
others to be found in <i>Martial</i>, that must be taken
as referring to the <i>fellator</i>; but since the maladies
that occur are equally prevalent in the case of the
<i>Cunnilingue</i>, it will be more convenient to adduce
them under that head. Further, we only require to
mention the fact that <i>pale lips</i> seem to have been
regarded as a mark of the <i>fellator</i><a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>.</p>

<p>But the vice of the <i>fellator</i> is far surpassed in
baseness by that of the <i>Cunnilingue</i> (<i>qui opus peragit
linguam arrigendo in cunnum, eumque lambit</i>,—one
who works by putting his tongue up into the female
organ, and licking it). The Greeks called this
practice σκύλαξ (a puppy), because it is a habit of
dogs<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>, and Hesychius explains it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
σχῆμα ἀφροδισιακὸν, ὡς τὸ τῶν φοινικιζόντων (a method of
love, resembling that of those who phoenicize). We
have already, in the passage of <i>Lucian</i> quoted a
little above, found φοινικίζειν and λεσβιάζειν put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
side by side; <i>Galen</i> moreover<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> does the same in
the following passage, a noteworthy one for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
purpose on several accounts: “The drinking of
sweat, urine and the menstrual blood of women is
vicious and shameful, and not less so when a person,
as Xenocrates proposes to do, smears the regions
of the mouth and throat with excrement, and swallows
it down. He speaks also of taking the wax of the
ears. For my part I could never bring myself to
take this, even though by that means I were never
to be ill again. But excrement I consider yet more
disgusting, and it is for a man of any decency far
more shameful to be called an Excrement-Eater<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
than an αἰσχρουργὸς (worker of obscenities) or a
<i>cinaedus</i>. But of αἰσχρουργοὶ<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> (workers of obscenities),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
we abominate Phoenicians more than the Lesbians,
and it seems to me the man does something of the
same sort as the former who drinks menstrual blood
(μᾶλλον βδελλυττόμεθα τοὺς <em class="gesperrt">φοινικίζοντας</em>
τῶν λεσβιαζόντων ᾧ<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> φαίνεταί μοι παραπλήσιόν
τι πάσχειν ὁ καὶ καταμηνίου πίνων.) <i>A sensible
man will neither seek to collect experiences on the point,
nor yet on a practice, which it is true involves less</i>,
but still is sufficiently shameful, that of smearing a
part of the body with excrement, because he has
some hurt at that spot,—or with human seed.
Xenocrates calls this latter commonly γόνος (seed,
semen), and distinguishes with minute care between
cases where simple seed rubbed in by itself is of
benefit, and cases where the female has the same
effect after combination with the male, as it is
discharged from the woman’s womb.”</p>

<p>This explanation of Galen’s to the effect that the
φοινικίζων (one who phoenicizes) resembles the
man who drinks menstrual blood, shows clearly that
φοινικίζειν is <i>not</i>, as all the Lexicons give it, and
<i>Forbiger</i> (loco citato) also assumes, identical with
λεσβιάζειν. It is true <i>Forbiger</i> (p. 329. Note v.)
gives the meaning <i>cunnilingere</i> as well, although the
explanation is undoubtedly unsatisfactory which he
offers <i>à propos</i> of an Epigram,<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>—one certainly apposite
in this connection, to the effect that the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
for this signification is, <i>quod cunnilingos a natando
in mari quodam Phoenicei coloris (mari rubro) dixissent</i>,
(that they had called them <i>cunnilingues</i> from
their swimming as it were in a sea of Phoenician
purple colour—a red sea); for the words in the
Epigram, ἐν φοινίκῃ δὲ καθεύδεις (but you sleep
in Phoenicia) cannot stand for anything else but
simply φοινικίζειν, as indeed the passage from
<i>Aloisia Sigaea</i>, which is quoted by Forbiger himself,
proves conclusively<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>: <i>Cum vellet mediam lambere,
se velle dicebat in Liguriam</i>, (When he wanted to
lick my middle, he used to say he would fain <i>be
into Liguria</i>—that is, would fain lick, <i>ligurire</i>).
Accordingly just as λεσβιάζειν came into use as the
distinctive name for the vice of the <i>fellator</i>, because
it was practised to a distinctive degree in Lesbos,
so too to be a <i>cunnilingue</i> was called φοινικίζειν,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
because the habit was at home among the Phoenicians.
Undoubtedly men’s shamelessness was carried so far
that they actually used women and girls at their
period of menstruation for this purpose,—a fact of
the highest interest for us, as we shall show directly.
<i>Seneca</i><a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> expresses himself plainly enough on the
subject: “Quid tu, cum Mamercum Scaurum consulem
faceres, ingnorabas, <em class="gesperrt">ancillarum suarum menstruum
ore illum hiante exceptare</em>? num
quid enim ipse dissimulabat? num quid purus
videri volebat?” (How came it you were ignorant,
when making Mamercus Scaurus consul, <i>that he was
in the habit of catching in his open mouth the menstrual
discharge of his maidservants</i>? Did he make any
concealment of it himself? did he pose as a pure-minded
man? nay! not he). Again in another place<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>:</p>

<p>“Nuper Natalis tam improbae linguae quam impurae,
<em class="gesperrt">in cuius ore feminae purgabantur</em>.”
(Quite lately Natalis showed himself as malignant of
tongue as he is unchaste, <i>into whose mouth women
were used to purge themselves</i>).</p>

<p>Now if first of all we bear steadfastly in mind
that this φοινικίζειν was a vice, which prevailed
primarily and especially among the Phoenicians and
was later on disseminated abroad by them, and then
consider how the Greeks designated every vice, and
particularly excesses in love, as νόσος (disease), in
the same way precisely as the Romans used <i>morbus</i>
(disease),—comp. § 17—we <i>must</i> see that φοινικίζειν
is the same thing as νόσος φοινικίη (Phoenician
disease), and shall be in a position to form an
opinion on the Gloss<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> falsely ascribed to <i>Galen</i>,
which reads: <em class="gesperrt">φοινικίη νόσος</em>· ἡ κατὰ Φοινίκην
καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἄλλα ἀνατολικὰ μέρη πλεονάζουσα.
δηλοῦσθαι δὲ κἀνταῦθα <em class="gesperrt">δοκεῖ</em> ἡ ἐλεφαντιάσις.
(<i>Phoenician disease</i>: a disease prevalent in Phoenicia
and about the Eastern parts. Elephantiasis <i>appears</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
to be signified by this).</p>

<p>Even granting the first part of this Gloss to have
been really written by <i>Galen</i>, the last sentence at
any rate is obviously an extraneous and later addition.
This is at once indicated by the use of the word
δοκεῖ (it appears), which comes in curiously, standing
as it does next-door to the <i>definite</i> statement that
this νόσος (disease) was common in Phoenicia; for
surely anyone who knew this, must also have known
what the disease was. Again if he had wished to
describe it by some such phrase as the English
“a sort of Elephantiasis”, he could hardly have
failed to express himself in a different way to what
he has. But as a matter of fact, <i>Galen</i> knew perfectly
well, as we have already seen, what φοινικίζειν
was, and consequently what the φοινικίη νόσος
(Phoenician disease) was, and it could not by any
possibility have occurred to him to suppose it any
form of Elephantiasis. Unfortunately <i>Prof. Naumann</i><a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
has allowed himself to be misled by this extraneous
addition; he writes: “In the Work of a Pseudo-Galen
is given a short explanation of the φοινικίη
νόσος (Phoenician disease), or rather to speak strictly,
the <i>conjecture</i> is made,<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> that this malady, a common
one in Phoenicia and the East, may have been
Elephantiasis.” True indeed the word might <i>with
equal likelihood</i> express a disease characterized by
redness of the skin φοινίκιος s. φοινίκεος i. q.
puniceus, purpureus, cruentus; φοινιγμὸς irritatio
cutis per vesicantia—φοινίκιος or φοινίκεος =<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Phoenician purple, purple, blood-red; φοινιγμὸς =
irritation of the skin by rubefacients). Or should
we suppose <i>some leprous-venereal malady</i> endemic and
aboriginal among the trading Phoenicians to be
signified, which was called the <i>Morbus Phoeniceus</i>
(Phoenician disease) in the same way as in more
modern times people spoke of the <i>Morbus Gallicus</i>
(French disease,—Syphilis)? In any case it is remarkable
that <i>Themison</i> (who also noted incidentally that
Satyriasis at times attacks a population epidemically,—speaks
of the special frequency of Satyriasis in Crete
(<i>Caelius Aurelianus</i>, Acut. Morb. bk. III. ch. 18).
As is well known, Phoenician and Hellenic Colonies
had converged here; and the island remained in
uninterrupted and active commercial intercourse with
the maritime cities of Phoenicia.</p>

<p>According to the general supposition the Gloss of
the Pseudo-Galen has reference to a passage of
<i>Hippocrates</i> occurring in the Second book of the
Prorrhetica,<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> where we read as follows: “But
λειχῆνες—tetters, as also λέπραι and λεῦκαι,—scaly
leprosies and white leprosies, where any of
these occur in the young or mere children, or after
appearing on a small scale shall then increase but
slowly, in these cases it is not right to call the
exanthema or eruption an apostasis, (transitional
state), but a νόσημα,—condition of disease. On the
other hand where any of these affections occurs on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
a large scale and suddenly, it would then be an
apostasis. But whereas λεῦκαι arise out of <i>the most
deadly diseases</i>, as e. g. the νοῦσος ἡ φθινικὴ,—wasting
disease, as it is called, λέπραι and λειχῆνες
do so from the melancholic, or diseases proceeding
from black bile. And of such the easier to cure are
those that occur in the youngest patients and are
of the latest origin, and arise in the softest and most
fleshy parts of the body.” <i>Foesius</i> observes on the
passage: “Nemini autem dubium est, quin hac parte
<em class="gesperrt">mendosi sint codices omnes</em>, cum ἡ νοῦσος
ἡ φθινικὴ καλουμένη scribitur. Nam φοινικίη
νόσος ex Galeni exegesi procul omni dubio reponendum.”
(Now no one can doubt that <i>all the
MSS. are deceptive</i> here, reading as they do ἡ νοῦσος
ἡ φθινική. For φοινικίη vόσος must undoubtedly
be restored from the Exegesis of Galen). <i>J. W. Wedel</i><a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
on the contrary writes: “Legunt quidam pro φοινικίη—φθινικὴ,
et vertunt tabem seu morbum tabidum,
<em class="gesperrt">sed contra fidem codicum correctiorum</em>,
quibus Galenus ipse assentitur, et rei ipsius, de qua
textus agit, evidentiam.” (Some read φθινικὴ for
φοινικίη, and render it <i>wasting</i> or <i>wasting disease</i>,—<i>but
against the authority of the better class of MSS.</i>,
with which Galen himself agrees, and against the
evidence of the context of the matter treated of).
In the latter of these two statements Wedel, in spite
of his mistaken view of the matter generally, is
perfectly right; whether he is so in the former as
well, we are not in a position to say, for alas! we
lack the critical apparatus absolutely indispensable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
such a decision, not so much as the Edition of
<i>Mackius</i> being on the shelves of our University
Library.</p>

<p>In the first place we ought to make quite sure
what Hippocrates understood under the name λεῦκαι.
A disease of the Skin no doubt; but of what particular
nature it was, would seem not to be so easy
to determine. According to <i>Coac. praenotion.</i> (Vol. I.
p. 321.) Hippocrates distinguished a λεύκη συγγενής
and a λεύκη μὴ συγγενής (λεύκη inborn, and not
inborn), the latter attacking individuals only after
puberty. <i>Hesychius</i> says λεύκη, ἄνθος τι τῶν περὶ
τὸ σῶμα γινόμενον, ἄλφος δὲ λευκή τις ἐν τῷ
σώματι. (λεύκη—white leprosy, an eruption coming
out on the exterior parts of the body, but ἄλφος—dull-white
leprosy, a form of λεύκη in the body).
<i>Galen</i>, <i>Definit. med.</i> (Vol. XIX. p. 140) λευκή ἐστιν
ἡ ἐπὶ λευκὸν χρῶμα τοῦ σώματος παρὰ φύσιν
μεταβολή. (λεύκη is the change to an unnatural
white colour of the body). According to this it would
appear to be merely superficial discolorations of the
skin that writers understood by λεῦκαι,—a view that
<i>Rayer</i><a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> seems to coincide with. <i>Pollux</i> on the other
hand offers an explanation as follows: ἀλφὸς μέλας,
ἐπιδρομὴ σκιώδης, ἐπιπόλαιος, εὐίατος, ἀλφὸς
λευκὸς, λευκότης ἐπιτρέχουσα τῇ ἐπιδερματίδι,
αὐχμηρὰ, δυσίατος· <em class="gesperrt">λεύκη</em>, ὅταν ἐπιτείνῃ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>ἡ
λευκότης, καὶ φύσῃ τρίχωσιν λευκήν, εἰ δὲ κεντήσειας,
ὕφαιμος, δυσίατος, ἐστιν ὅτε ὑπέρυθρος·
<em class="gesperrt">ἐπανθεῖ δὲ</em> αὐτὸ (?) τοῖς <em class="gesperrt">χείλεσιν, οἷον
ἁλὸς ἄχνη</em>. (Black ἀλφός, a dark-coloured spreading
eruption, superficial and easily curable; white
alphos, a whiteness running over the epidermis (of
the prepuce), dry harsh and difficult to cure; λεύκη,
when the whiteness extends, and produces a growth
of white hairs, and if you prick it, it is suffused with
blood, difficult to cure, also sometimes reddish in
hue. And the eruption comes out on the lips <i>like
sea-foam</i>). Here λεύκη is evidently a much more
deeply penetrating malady, as indeed it is described
by <i>Celsus</i><a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and <i>Galen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> It corresponds with the
white Leprosy of Moses. But the most curious thing
is the statement appended to the effect that the
affection broke out on the lips like sea-foam. This
is certainly to be referred to some other form of
λεύκη, unless indeed we are to take it in connection
with the succeeding words in the text, λειχὴν ἄγριο<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>ς
(malignant tetter), in which case, as we have seen
with regard to Mentagra (Tetter of the chin), the
remark is based on a perfectly sound observation;
and besides, the αὐτὸ gives absolutely no sense.
On the other hand if Pollux’datum in reference to
the seat of λεύκη is correct, it must obviously afford
much light for clearing up the meaning of the passage
in Hippocrates, and in deference to it we shall be
bound to read φοινικίη instead of φθινικὴ,<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
emendation that presents no difficulty, since φθινικὴ
might very easily be read for φοινικίη, and indeed
(as pointed out in the Note) was actually so read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>But one emendation leads on to another, and we
shall find ourselves bound, on the analogy of the
θαυμαστὸν πάθος (wonderful complaint) in Dio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Chrysostom, to read here also θαυμαστωτάτων
νοσημάτων (of the most wonderful diseases) for
θανατωδεστάτων ν., and translate accordingly:
“but λεῦκαι arise out of the most terrible aberrations
of the mind,” such for instance as the vice of the
<i>cunnilingue</i> is. If we examine further, we shall see
it is not λευκαὶ but λεῦκαι that stands in the text,
so it cannot be a question of a skin-affection of the
leprosy type at all, for λευκὸς (white) rather implies
transparent and shiny, and <i>Martial</i> (XI. 99.) in a
passage to be discussed more fully later on, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Non ulcus acre, <em class="gesperrt">pustulaeve lucentes</em>,</div>
  <div class="verse">Nec triste mentum, sordidique lichenes,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(No biting ulcer, or <i>shiny pustules</i>, nor yet disfigured
chin, and foul scabs). Accordingly we have here
nothing whatever to do with the leprous-like λευκὴ,
but only with <i>pustulae lucentes</i> (shiny pustules),
which as we shall show presently were a consequence
of the practices of the <i>cunnilinigue</i>. We
have the more right to assume this, as the old
Physicians ascribe λευκὴ to the φλέγμα (phlegmatic
humour),—an explanation all the more likely
to have been given, as directly afterwards follow the
words, αἱ δὲ λέπραι καὶ οἱ λειχῆνες ἐκ τῶν
μελαγχολικῶν (but leprosies and tetters arise out of
the melancholic diseases). True this is in contradiction
with another passage of Hippocrates,<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> for in this
we read: <em class="gesperrt">λέπρη</em> καὶ κνησμὸς καὶ ψώρη καὶ
<em class="gesperrt">λειχῆνες</em> καὶ ἀλφὸς καὶ ἀλώπεκες ὑπὸ <em class="gesperrt">φλέγματος</em>
γίνονται. (<i>leprosy</i>, and itch, and scab, and
<i>tetters</i>, and dull-white leprosy, and manges, arise
from <i>phlegm</i>). This much at any rate appears to
us to result, viz. that the whole passage under
discussion cannot possibly be by Hippocrates, but
much more probably is due to some author of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Alexandrine age, who enjoyed ample opportunities
for studying the consequences of the unnatural excesses
as so often observed since Pompey the Great’s time.</p>

<p>To assume that Hippocrates was actually acquainted
with these in any completeness would up to the
present be premature; at any rate we are bound,
so far as our study of his writings enables us to
judge, to deny him any knowledge of the fact that
sexual excesses were the cause of the different
affections of the genital organs chronicled by him.
Of course he may have supposed all this to be
notorious and the knowledge of it common property,
but a host of statements would be found to tell
against any such supposition. Opportunities of making
acquaintance with the vice of the <i>cunnilingue</i> could
certainly not have been lacking, it being so familiar
a thing in his time that <i>Aristophanes</i><a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> again and
again derided it in his Comedies. Whatever conclusion
we come to on this head, at least the passage
of Hippocrates cannot justify anyone in maintaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
that the φοινικίη νοῦσος,—(Phœnician disease) was
true Elephantiasis, even if, as may be, the preliminary
proposition that elephantiasis was a <i>consequence</i> of
debauchery be made good,—a point to which we
propose later on to return. On the subject of
Satyriasis in Crete, we have already expressed our
views.</p>

<p>Just as the Phoenicians carried the seed of the
vice to Greece and other lands, so at a later period
was it disseminated from Syria to Italy; and so
<i>Ausonius</i> says (Epigr. 128.):</p>

<small>§ 24.</small></h4>

<p>Can anyone believe such a vice as this was practised
without incurring punishment? Yet there prevails
amongst the Physicians of Antiquity, even including
Galen, who knew the facts, an unbroken silence. It is
impossible to suppose that girls and women could
have their genital organs purged in this mode altogether
without evil results, more particularly as actual
experience in more modern times has proved that
as a consequence of the habit of <i>cunnilingere</i> inflammations
of the external genitals have been set up
in girls, as well as ulcerations in older women through
the licking of these parts by dogs. Among Ancient
writers we have found no vouchers for this; but on
the other hand several such exist to show the mischief
that results from the habit to the <i>cunnilingue</i> himself.
Excluding from consideration the <i>pale complexion</i><a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and evil <i>smell from the mouth</i>, which were equally
consequences of the other forms of vice already
mentioned, we have <i>paralysis of the tongue</i> mentioned,
at any rate in one passage<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Sidere percussa est subito tibi, Zoile, lingua,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Dum lingis. Certe, Zoile, nunc futuis.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Your tongue, Zoilus, has been stricken with a sudden
doom, while in the act of licking. Why! surely,
Zoilus, you copulate now). True this malady must
be counted as one of very rare occurrence; but this
is by no means the case with the ulcerations, which
would seem not always to have confined their attacks
to the tongue, but to have extended also, just as
with the <i>fellator</i>, to the other parts of the mouth as
well. This cannot but have had the effect of making
it very difficult in diagnosis to distinguish between
an affection of the sort due to <i>fellation</i> and one due
to the vice of the <i>cunnilingue</i>.</p>

<p>Here again it is <i>Martial</i> to whom we are indebted
for the proofs of our assertions. He leaves no room
for doubt as to the way Manneius was punished for
his debauchery in the following passage<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>:</p>

<p>(<i>Manneius was a husband with his tongue, a fornicator
with his mouth, a more polluted wretch than the big-cheeked
wenches of the suburbs.</i> When a vile bawd
saw him naked from a window in the Suburra, she
shuts her brothel up, and had rather kiss his middle
than his head. The man who but now could <i>penetrate
every vessel of the inwards</i>, and say with assured
voice and certain knowledge whether it were a boy
or a girl in the mother’s belly,—rejoice, rejoice,
organs of women, for your business is done for
you,—the same <i>cannot erect a fornicating tongue</i>.
For at the very moment <i>he is plunged tight in the
swollen vulva</i>, and hears the babes whimpering within,
lo! <i>a shocking disease paralyses his greedy tongue</i>. <i>Now
can he be neither clean, nor yet unclean</i>).</p>

<p>The Commentators, in particular <i>Farnabius</i>, refer
the complaint spoken of in the passage just quoted
to paralysis of the tongue. Farnabius says in fact:
“Paralysisne ἀπὸ τῆς ἀφέδρου καὶ τῶν ἐμμηνιῶν,
quorum malefico humore marcescunt segetes, apes
moriuntur etc., Plin. c. 15 Lib. V., an sideratio?”
(Is paralysis intended, <i>resulting from the menstruation
and menstrual</i> discharges, the poisonous humour of
which will wither up crops, kill bees, etc.—Pliny ch.
15. Bk. V., or a sudden stroke?) Even supposing
us willing to admit the possibility of menstrual blood
bringing on paralysis of the tongue, there can at any
rate be no question of such a thing here, inasmuch
as it was with a pregnant woman Manneius carried
out his vicious practises, and women in pregnancy
do not <i>usually</i> menstruate,—a fact about which the
Philologist naturally enough was only imperfectly
posted. Of course the possibility is always there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
although the Poet says nothing about it; and the
expression <i>vulva tumens</i> (swollen organ) evidently
stands here, as is clearly shown by what follows, for
<i>uterus gravidus</i> (pregnant womb)<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>. The <i>solvere</i> (to
loose, destroy) points in any case to a destruction, a
dwindling, of the part, brought about by the <i>indecens
morbus</i> (shocking disease),—which disease might very
likely find its explanation in the <i>scelerata lues</i> (noxious
contagion) mentioned on page 258 above. As a
result of this, naturally enough not only did <i>arrigere</i>
(to erect—the tongue) become impossible, but the
<i>impurus</i> (<i>Cunnilingus</i>) (unclean cunnilingue) grew generally
incapable of practising his vice. Nor yet was he
<i>purus</i> (clean)<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> altogether, for was he not a <i>cunnilingue</i>?—and
now he was even less <i>purus</i>, because
he suffered from the <i>indecens morbus</i> (shocking disease),
which even Farnabius has so far rightly understood,
that he explains <i>nec purus</i> (nor yet clean) by <i>morbo
illo contaminatus</i> (because contaminated by the said
disease).</p>

<p>Rather more doubtful and difficult is the interpretation
of the following passage of <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>, which
would yet appear to be pertinent here:</p>

<p>(I never called you a <i>cinaedus</i>, Coracinus; I am not
so rash or so reckless, not being one to speak lies
willingly. If I called you a <i>cinaedus</i>, Coracinus, may
Pontia’s jar be my enemy, and Metilius’poisoned
cup. <i>I take oath by your Syrian tumours, by your
Berecynthian frenzies.</i> What I <i>did</i> say is a trivial,
an insignificant thing, a thing well known, that you
will not yourself deny,—<i>I said</i>, Coracinus, <i>you were
a cunnilingue</i>).</p>

<p>What were these <i>Syrii tumores</i> (Syrian tumours)
that afflicted the <i>cunnilingue</i> Coracinus? <i>Beroaldus</i>,
Annotat. ch. 25., understands them as “tumores et
vibices a cultris et flagris quibus sacerdotes Cybeles
(quam deam Syriam esse volunt) se sauciabant.”
(the swellings and weals from the knives and scourges
with which the priests of Cybelé,—whom they claim
to be the Syrian goddess—used to wound themselves).
<i>Farnabius</i> on the contrary thinks only <i>Berecynthios
furores</i> (Berecynthian frenzies) to be intended in this
explanation, and makes the <i>tumores Syrii</i> mean
“<i>ulcera et morbos quibus credebatur irata Isis inflare
peierantes</i>,” (ulcers and maladies with which the angry
Isis was supposed to afflict false swearers), appealing
to the passage of Persius<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>, already brought forward
a few pages back (p. 254.), which reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Hinc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos,</div>
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Incussere Deos inflantes corpora</em>, si non</div>
  <div class="verse">Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>
<p>(Then the tall Galli, and the one-eyed priestess with
her sacred rattle, instil terror of <i>the gods that make
men’s bodies swell</i>, unless three times at dawn you
have eaten the prescribed head of garlic).</p>

<p>Whether this passage affords any direct proof would
seem doubtful, inasmuch as the <i>inflare corpus</i> (to make
the body swell) properly speaking only refers to the
abdomen. To this also the eating of the allium
(garlic), which no doubt first won its magic significance
on account of its carminative properties, appears
to point.</p>

<p>However another explanation is possible. Referring
back to the passage of <i>Porphyrius</i> quoted above
on p. 254., the <i>tumores</i> Coracinus had contracted in
consequence of his general incontinence with women,
which incontinence had at last brought him as a
<i>senex</i>? (old man) to such a condition of weakness
that nothing was left him but the vice of <i>cunnilingere</i>
to satisfy his still unexhausted lubricity. A side light
in this case may be thrown on the matter by Horace’s
description of the <i>Anus libidinosa</i> (The lecherous old
woman) in Epodes VIII. 9. 19.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Venter mollis et femur <em class="gesperrt">tumentibus</em></div>

  <div class="verse">Quod ut superbo provoces ab inguine</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Ore allaborandum est tibi.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Flabby belly and skinny thigh joined with swollen
calves,—A tool, that requires you, in order to call
it up from the supercilious groin, to work it with
the mouth). <i>Casaubon</i> in his commentary on the
passage of <i>Persius</i> is for connecting this, as well as
the <i>Tumores Syrii</i>, with ἕλκεα Συριακὰ (Syrian
sores), and—as quoted on p. 253 above—to regard
them as a consequence of the wrath of the <i>Dea Syria</i>
(Syrian goddess). No doubt as a matter of fact the
<i>tumores</i> were a result of debauchery, one that was
prevalent in Syria and was disseminated thence to
Rome, for they attacked a <i>cunnilingue</i> no less than
other debauchees; but this brings us no nearer to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
knowledge of their nature. We should perhaps be
inclined to regard them as swellings of the tonsils
or of the lympathic glands of the throat, having the
same significance as the inguinal buboes in affections
of the genitals.</p>

<p>But what are the <i>Berecynthii furores</i> (Berecynthian
frenzies)? Possibly nocturnal pains in the bones,
that torment a patient to the pitch of frenzy? The
metaphor, drawn from the nocturnal rites of Cybelé,
must be admitted to be a happy one. Still, however
acceptable conjectures of the sort may be to many,
we cannot take them seriously. It appears to us
most judicious to regard the <i>Syrii tumores</i> as being
ulcerations that covered the body of Coracinus, and
by their violent itching reduced him to a state of
frenzy. Our view as stated is confirmed by Epigram
108. of <i>Ausonius</i>:</p>

the sores on his limbs all rotten with scab, he preferred
so entertaining a spectacle to all the games.
First he beats the air with twittering, whining noises,
and utters broken sounds in imitation of the wanton
embraces of harlots, and completes the symphony
of his foul-minded lechery. <i>Then he twirls his arms
about like a Maenad under the god’s afflatus</i>; breast,
legs, flank, belly, thighs, <i>groin</i>, <i>calves</i>, back, neck,
shoulders, cave of the bemired Symplegades,—i.e.
hollow between buttocks,—in so many different
places does the shooting torture fly, until he droops
and faints in the warmth of the hot bath and the
disease is soothed and gives a fatal respite. So it
is said castrated eunuchs, when barren desire tries
hard for embraces with women and for contests they
cannot properly engage in, are consumed with empty
transports on the tossed and tumbled bed,—till eventually
their lust, tickled and tickled, flames high for
a last moment, and completes the wanton act by
applying the mouth and biting. So with Polygiton
a final spasm relaxes his disfigured limbs, and the
last sin-offerings of his life being due, thus makes
himself ready for the waves of Phlegethon).</p>

<p>True the connexion with the vice of <i>cunnilingere</i>
is apparently lost here, but this also may be preserved
without any great straining of the words, as we shall
see presently; and accordingly the <i>Tumores Syrii</i>
can be quite well regarded as a consequence of the
vice of the <i>cunnilingus</i>.</p>

<small>§ 25.</small></h4>

<p>Ever since the so-called first appearance of Venereal
Disease, most of the advocates of the antiquity of
the complaint have made a point of bringing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
<i>Mentagra</i><a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> within the purview of the quotations
they adduce to prove their contention, although
strictly speaking they were never likely to succeed
in a direct demonstration that the disease was really
and truly connected with sexual excesses. Accordingly,
to the present day the majority of them see
in it nothing more than a form of Leprosy, particularly
as <i>Hensler</i><a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and <i>Sprengel</i> were among those
who decided in favour of its leprous character.
Instead of giving a useless list of names of the different
authors, who in former days declared for the
one view or the other, we think it more expedient
to quote first of all the capital authority, a passage
in Pliny<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>, setting this down as it stands so as to
be able afterwards to form a correct appreciation of
its bearing:</p>

<p>(Ch. I. Moreover the human <i>face</i> experienced
new diseases, and such as had been unknown in
any former age not merely to Italy but to the whole
of Europe very nearly, and these not widely diffused
over Italy generally, or through Illyricum or the
provinces of Gaul or of Spain, or indeed anywhere
else but just in Rome and its neighbourhood. They
were painless, it is true, and did not involve loss of
life, but were of such a horrible nature that death
in any form would have been preferable.</p>

<p>Ch. II. The most serious of these diseases they
called <i>lichenes</i>,—scabs, a Greek name; in Latin, as
the malady generally showed itself first on the chin,
it was known as <i>mentagra</i>,—chin-bane, scab or tetter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
of the chin, at the first by way of jest and mockery—for
it is the nature of the multitude to make merry
at others’misfortunes,—but soon this became the
recognized word. In many persons it covered absolutely
the whole countenance, the eyes alone being
left unaffected, with a horrible scurf of the skin, going
down sometimes to the neck as well, and breast,
and hands.</p>

<p>Ch. III. <i>This plague</i> had not existed among our
ancestors or fathers. For the first time it crept into
Italy in the middle of the reign of <i>Tiberius Claudius
Caesar</i>, a certain Perusinius, a Roman knight and
Quaestorian secretary, after a period of service in
Asia, importing the contagion from there. But women
did not suffer from the malady, or slaves, nor yet
common folk of humble or middle-class station; but
nobles, and this particularly by the rapid infection
of an embrace. In many cases the scar, where
patients had submitted to medical treatment, was
more horrible than the disease itself. For indeed
it was curable by caustics, except when the body
had been consumed to the very bones, the slowness
of the treatment defeating its own end. Physicians
arrived from Egypt, <i>mother-land of such taints</i>, practising
this cure exclusively, to their own great profit.
If, that is, it is true that Manilius Cornutus, of the
Praetorians and governor of the Province of Aquitania,
offered 200,000 sesterces for his cure when attacked
by this disease).</p>

<p>Here if ever, it particularly behoves us to begin
with an elucidation of the meaning of the name
given to the malady under discussion. <i>Gruner</i><a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
long ago called attention to the divergence of opinion
as to the signification of λειχῆνες (scabs) among the
writers of Antiquity, but without success in putting
the actual facts in a clear light. We must try if we
can be more fortunate. An old etymologist says:
λειχὴν παρὰ τὸ λείχω, καὶ γὰρ φάσιν ἐκ το<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>ῦ
λείχειν τὸ πάθος ἐπαίρεται<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>, (λειχὴν comes from
λείχω,—I lick, because they say the complaint is
set up by licking). On this we may say.—there is
no doubt λειχῆνες and λιχῆνες are derived from
λείχειν or λίχειν, but the explanation <i>Kraus</i> gives
of the reason in his Lexicon we cannot think conceivable,
viz. “because Lichen, the same as a parasitic
plant does, or a skin-disease in animals, always creeps
round further and further (see <i>Herpes</i>,—creeping
eruption), or <i>as it were licks its way</i>,” for λείχειν
is not so much <i>lambere</i>, λάπτειν,—to lick over, lick
along, as <i>lingere</i>, <i>ligurire</i><a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>,—to lick up, lick up greedily.
At the same time it is true the word (<i>lambere</i>) was
used by the Romans in a somewhat similar sense,
so perhaps we ought not to refer to <i>lambit flamma</i>
(a flame licks), but rather to Plautus’expression
(<i>Pers. prolog. 5.</i>), “<i>quorum imagines lambunt hederae
sequaces</i>” (whose images creeping ivy-tendrils lick,
i.e. entwine). Most probably there are two different
stems underlying the word. Of these one is λέγειν,—to
lay, etc., hence λέγνη, the edging, the border,
λίγνυς, soot (depositing itself on the edge), together
with the bye-forms λέχω, λίχω with which in fact
λιχὴν, <i>moss</i><a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>, so far as it forms on the edge, the
surface, fringes it, would be connected. The other
stem will be λίγω, or λείγω (comp. λίβω and λείβω),
λείχω and λείχην, λίγγω, λίζω, to which would
have to be referred also λίγυς and λιγυρὸς,—clear,
shrill (ligurire, lingere,—to lick greedily, to lick), in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
all of which the underlying sense is of licking, and
the noise connected with it.</p>

<p>It is plain that later on the derivatives of these
stems suffered manifold variations and corruptions;
but how much of all this is to be attributed to
speakers and writers among the Greeks themselves,
and how much to subsequent transcribers and editors
of their work, it might be difficult to decide. But
every day we have occasion to note a number of
words, to which accident or other circumstances
have given an ambiguous character. These, used
quite unsuspectingly by the ignorant, make the better
informed person blush, or else extort a smile from
him that often enough causes the speaker no little
embarrassment to know the reason. Undoubtedly
it was the same with the Greeks and Romans, and
so confusions between λίχω and λείχω, λιχὴν and
λειχὴν, might have easily arisen, from which people
were subsequently unable to extricate themselves.
Originally perhaps λείχω, equally with <i>lingo</i> and
<i>ligurio</i> (to lick), may have had the simple sense of
licking, and only through later accretions to the
meaning, have acquired an ambiguous character;
soon however this got transferred to it to the exclusion
of all others, and we find it used preferentially
as the regular word for <i>cunnilingere</i>. The correctness
of our conclusion would seem to follow
above all from the passage of <i>Aristophanes</i><a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
below, where it is the additional words that narrow
down the meaning of λείχω (I lick), and definitely
bring out the special signification. The words are
said of Ariphrades, who reminds us of the ἀποφρὰς
(unmentionable), the name Lucian appropriates to
Timarchus:</p>

<p>(Χείλων,—a proper name, also means <i>of the lips</i>,—and
λείχων,—licking,—have the like letters; now
what does this point to? Chilon licks lips, whether
lips like his own, or whether unlike). In explanation
of this Epigram <i>Forbiger</i> says (loco citato p. 326.):
“Lusus in Chilonem cunnilingum. Hunc ait iure
quodam suo lingere, qui vel nomine iisdem literis
constante prae se fert lingentem et lingentem quidem
tum labra oris, ut labris ligentis similia, tum
cunni, ut dissimilia.” (Pun on the name of Chilon,
a <i>cunnilingue</i>. The poet says he (Chilon) licks by
a sort of inherent right of his own, who even in his
name, made up of the same letters, proclaims himself
as licking, and licking now the lips of the mouth,
which are like the lips of the licker, now those of
the female organ, which are unlike). Χεῖλος was
in fact used also of the lips of a woman’s organ,
the <i>nymphae</i>; the Scholiast on τὰς ἐσχάρας (the
<i>nymphae</i>) in the passage from Aristophanes given a
little above, interprets this word by τὰ χείλη τῶν
γυναικείων αἰδοίων (the lips of the female privates).
According to <i>Schneider</i> in his Lexicon χείλων (adj.)
signifies <i>thick-lipped</i>. Perhaps it was this very Epigram
that led <i>Lambert Bosius</i> to make the statement that
χείλων arose by a mere transposition of the letters
from λείχον.</p>

<p>Now if λείχην,—for we consider it should be thus
accented,—is derived from λείχω (I lick), we cannot
but regard it as meaning: something <i>produced by
licking, a complaint brought on by licking</i>, and particularly
<i>by the licking of the cunnilingue</i>! Surely the
Greeks could hardly have expressed themselves more
clearly. Then the fact that the name came from
the mouth of the common people is the very best
reason for its not having been understood by the
educated. Yet all the while an entirely similar form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
of expression has grown up in the mouth of the
German common people, the real meaning of which
very few have fathomed, but which most certainly
arose in the same way as the Greek λείχην. No
doubt many of my readers have again and again
heard it said of some one with an eruption round
the mouth, that is, someone suffering from <i>Herpes
labialis</i> (Creeping eruption of the lips): “Well! you
<i>have</i> been licking!”—for which educated people
substitute the obviously insufficient, “You <i>have</i> been
picking!” Very commonly again one may hear:
“You <i>have</i> been licking <i>greben</i>, or picking <i>greben</i>;
and this word <i>greben</i> is understood as being identical
with <i>grieben</i>,—<i>greaves</i> in English, i.e. the remnants
of lard that has been cut up into pieces and fried,
because the separate pustules of the <i>herpes labialis</i>
resemble in appearance the <i>greaves</i>. So people sometimes
also say still more explicitly, “You <i>have</i> been
licking, or picking, <i>greaves</i>; and one of them has
been left sticking to your mouth, to prove your
greediness!”</p>

<p>This explanation may seem a very likely one to
many; nevertheless we incline to believe the word
to be of later origin, and to have arisen from ignorance
of the actual facts. We consider it more
probable that <i>greben</i> owes its origin to some corruption
of language growing out of <i>gremium</i>, the bosom.
We have been led to this conjecture by a statement
of <i>Adelung’s</i> in his Dictionary, Article “Grieben”,
where he says: “In middle-Latin <i>grieben</i>, (greaves),
were called, in accordance with a common interchange
change of the letters b. and m. <i>gremium</i>”,—though
indeed we cannot regard the word as solely and
entirely mediæval Latin, for it is found occurring
as early as <i>Pliny</i> (Hist. Nat. XII. 19.) and <i>Columella</i>
(Res Rust. XII. 19. 3.), and is evidently connected
with <i>cremare</i> (to burn). So just as in this case
<i>cremium</i> and <i>gremium</i> may have been used interchangeably,
has <i>grebe</i> grown out of <i>greme</i> in German,
and the latter come to be used as a synonym of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
<i>griebe</i>,—the latter words according to this having as
little in common with one another as the former.
However those better practised in the science of
word formation must here decide!</p>

<p>Now as to the word <i>Mentagra</i> (Tetter, Scab).
This was evidently a word first framed by the
Romans, as is distinctly stated not alone by <i>Pliny</i>,
but by <i>Galen</i> as well (De compos. medic. secundum
locos Bk. V., edit. Kühn Vol. XII. p. 839.). The
latter says: Ἐκδόριον λειχήνων· ταύτῃ Πάμφιλος
χρησάμενος ἐπὶ Ῥώμης πλεῖστον ἐπορίσατο <em class="gesperrt">ἐπικρατούσης
ἐν τῇ πόλει τῆς μεντάγρας
λεγομένης</em>. (Blister for Lichenes (Scabs); in this
way Pamphilus in his practise at Rome made most
headway against <i>the Mentagra as it was called, then
prevalent in the city</i>). It is usually considered to be
formed on the analogy of <i>Podagra</i>, <i>Chiragra</i> (gout
of the feet, gout of the hands) etc. from <i>mentum</i>,
the chin, and ἄγρα, the act of catching, seizing
hold of,—so a disease that attacks the chin. But
more probably all these words are compounded not
with ἄγρα at all, but with ἄλγος (suffering). That
is to say just as ἀλγαλέος, by Attic interchange of
letters, becomes ἀργαλέος (grievous), κεφαλαλγία
becomes κεφαλαργία (head-ache), and ληθαλγία,
ληθαργία (drowsiness, lethargy), so from ποδαλγία
we get ποδαργία, and then by metathesis ποδάγρα
(gout). (Comp. <i>Doederlein</i> “Lateinische Synonyme
und Etymologien”,—Latin Synonyms and Etymologies
Pt. 4. p. 424.). The remark <i>Pliny</i> adds however
“<i>ioculari primum lascivia</i>” (at first by way of
jesting mockery) evidently points to some ambiguity
underlying the word. But whether this consists in
the recognition of the likeness in sound between
<i>mentum</i>, the chin, and <i>menta</i>, or <i>mentula</i>, the virile
member, or is to be looked for in the ἄγρα, it might
be difficult to determine. Still it seems probable,
but without wishing to entirely exclude the former
hypothesis, that the latter is the case, as will appear
directly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> distinguishes between λειχὴν ἁπλοῦς and
λειχὴν ἄγριος (simple <i>lichen</i>, and malignant <i>lichen</i>)
in his enumeration of Skin-diseases, and still more
plainly in another place<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> he says: “λειχὴν is likewise
a Skin-disease; there are two forms of it,
ὁ μὲν ἥμερος καὶ πρᾳότερος, ὁ δὲ ἄγριος καὶ
χαλεπώτερος (the one benignant and milder, the
other malignant and more serious). But in both of
them minute scales are detached from the skin, and
the part of the skin underneath the scales is reddened
and almost ulcerated. The affection arises
from a salt phlegmatic humour (φλέγματος ἁλμυροῦ)
and yellow gall, hence the scales fall from the skin
as in glazed pottery-ware (? ἐπὶ τῶν ἁλμῶν τῶν
κεραμίων). The affection is cured by internal phlegmagogues
and external embrocations.” We have
already on p. 139. above, in the footnote on ἄγριος
(wild, savage) and χαλεπός (hard, harsh), noted how
these words are used with special reference to the
vice of paederastia, but they are also applied generally
to the vice, the different forms of which we
have been examining here. This follows from <i>Plato</i><a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
and <i>Plutarch</i><a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>, at any rate so far as ἄγριος is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
concerned, which indeed we may conveniently render
by <i>vicious</i>. The original meaning being overlooked,
λείχην and λιχὴν had been taken as synonymous,—possibly
the Latin <i>lichenos</i> first led to the mistake;
then naturally enough an appropriate epithet was
sought, to signify the <i>lichen</i> which was the result of
licking in a vicious fashion. But this according to
the already existing mode of speech could be nothing
else than ἄγριος<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> again,—λειχὴν ἄγριος, with which
λειχὴν ἁπλοῦς, <i>lichen insons</i>, (simple, innocent <i>lichen</i>)
was naturally contrasted.</p>

<p>Yet while <i>Criton</i>, as cited in <i>Aëtius</i>, simply and
quite correctly interpreted Mentagra by ἄγριος λειχὴν
(fierce, malignant lichen), <i>Galen</i> appears to have been
still ignorant of the special meaning. This is shown
by the words ἥμερος and πρᾳότερος (gentle, benignant,—milder),
which obviously are correct opposites
of ἄγριος only <i>if</i> the latter is understood, as it is
in <i>Celsus</i>, as equivalent to <i>ferus</i> (fierce, malignant),
but in no way account for the ἁπλοῦς (simple,
innocent), which Galen no doubt found already
established as distinguishing epithet of λιχὴν. How
little he fathomed the nature of the evil, is proved
by his ætiology of it, which makes the complaint
result from the φλέγμα ἁλμυρὸν (salt phlegmatic
humour) and the χολὴ ξανθὴ (yellow gall). The
unprofessional <i>Martial</i> had a better word to say on
the subject when he wrote his <i>sordidique lichenes</i>
(filthy, squalid-looking lichens). Similarly it would
seem the <i>agra</i> in Mentagra should be taken as
pointing to ἄγριος (fierce, malignant). Can it be
perhaps that in this way the μολύνων τὴν ὑπήνην
(polluting the hair on the upper lip) of <i>Aristophanes</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the Latin <i>barbam inquinare</i> (to pollute the beard),
have come to be used as synonyms for <i>cunnilingere</i>?
<i>Martial</i> seems to imply it by his <i>triste mentum</i>,
<i>mentum periculosum</i> (disfigured chin, perilous chin).
Perhaps too the <i>Sycosis menti</i> (Sycosis,—fig-like
eruption, of the chin) of <i>Celsus</i> and the later Greek
medical writers should likewise be regarded as coming
under this head. At a matter of fact, <i>Archigenes</i>
says so in so many words, as cited in <i>Galen</i> (De
comp. med. secundum locos. Bk. V. edit. Kühn
Vol. XII. p. 847.), ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν συκωδῶν τῶν
ἐπὶ τοῦ γενείου, λεγομένων δὲ μενταγρῶν,
ὑπὸ δέ τινων λειχήνων ἀγρίων, ποιεῖ κ. τ. λ.
(but in the case of the sycotic, or fig-like, eruptions
on the chin, which are called mentagrae, and by
others malignant lichens, he proceeds as follows, etc.),
and calls the affection of the chin, as do other
Physicians, generally ἐξανθήματα ἐν τοῖς γενείοις
(efflorescences, eruptions on the chin),—p. 824.</p>

<p>If we have thus succeeded in establishing the
meanings of <i>lichens</i> and <i>mentagra</i>, the rest of the
passage of <i>Pliny</i> will admit of easy explanation.
The disease in many cases it seems invaded the
whole face, in the same way as the <i>atra lues</i> (black
contagion) in the passages quoted above from
<i>Martial</i> under <i>fellation</i>. Perhaps all of these,—indeed,
<i>Pliny</i> also says <i>lues</i>,—are the be referred,
as is actually done by <i>Farnabius</i> in his notes,
to <i>mentagra</i>, seeing that the disease could perfectly
well, though certainly much seldomer, arise equally
from the practise of <i>fellation</i>. The <i>double entendre</i>
between <i>mentum</i> (the chin) and <i>menta</i> or <i>mentula</i>
(the virile member) would so acquire all the more
point.</p>

<p>The expression <i>foedo cutis furfure</i> (with a horrible
scurf of the skin) appears to have led a number of
authors to believe that this was the capital characteristic
of the complaint, and that the distinction
between λιχὴν and λείχην was merely one of
degree. This view was advocated in particular by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
<i>Willian</i><a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>, who ascribes it also to <i>Paulus Aegineta</i><a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
as well as to <i>Oribasius</i><a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> though both of these authors
limit themselves to saying that the moderately siccative
remedies are of no benefit in λείχην ἄγριος
(malignant lichen), whereas the more violent ones
aggravate it, and that for this reason it was called
ἄγριος. Hence Willian’s <i>Lichen agrius</i> (malignant
lichen) has nothing in common with the <i>lichen</i> of
the Greeks and Romans but the mere name, for it
follows clearly from the words <i>foediore cicatrice</i> (with
a more horrible scar) that occur a little further down
in <i>Pliny</i>, that a process of skinning over by ulceration
was part of the disease, and did not owe its
existence solely to the caustic remedies employed.</p>

<p>The <i>immunity of women</i><a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> equally admits of easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
explanation, for in the first place women were not
likely to have readily conceived the idea of acting
after the manner of a <i>cunnilingue</i><a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>, and even if
<i>fellation</i> is admitted to be an occasionally concurrent
cause of <i>mentagra</i>, still it would seem, as already
stated, to supervene much less often as a consequence
of the latter vice; while in cases where it does, it
is of a milder form and it is rather the internal parts
of the mouth that are imperilled. Besides, it is to
be remembered that women generally speaking suffer
less frequently from pustulous disorders of the cutaneous
glands affecting the face than men do, as is well
seen at the present day with Acne. In the parts
neighbouring on the genitals this is exactly reversed.
Still this immunity of women must not be insisted
on too far, as those persons of the female sex who
used to practise <i>fellation</i>, the Summoenianae (women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
of the suburbs) lay too completely outside the range
of <i>Pliny’s</i> observation.</p>

<p>As to the <i>servi</i> (slaves) and <i>Plebs humilis</i> (Commons
of humble station), these were surely unlikely, however
little restraint they may have put on their sensual
appetites, to have readily fallen into suchlike forms
of vice,—forms which spring as a rule from the brain
of unoccupied, rich idlers. We have only to appeal
to modern experience to substantiate this. How
many individuals of the lowest and middle classes
have the records of forensic medicine to show as
having been paederasts and so on? Wild aberrations
in morals have at no period begun with the common
man! So we see it was the Proceres (Nobles) who
were in an especial degree attacked by the <i>mentagra</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time the most conspicuous cause of
<i>mentagra</i>, the practice of <i>cunnilingere</i> was by no means
the <i>only</i> way of getting it, for the malady, like <i>condylomata</i>
on the genital organs, was evidently connected
with a contagion,—a fact which is clearly enough
brought out by the layman <i>Pliny</i>, whereas the Physicians
say nothing about this. Accordingly the disorder
was capable of being disseminated by <i>kissing</i> from
one individual to another. But it was not the <i>velox
transitus osculi</i> (swift transmission of a kiss) that was
instrumental in spreading the disease, but rather the
<i>basium</i> (wanton kiss),—which depended on some yet
unidentified lascivious device<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>, sucking, playing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the tongue or the like. Still we must remember that
at the very time the <i>mentagra</i> was spreading with
such terrible rapidity, a perfect <i>mania for kissing</i> had
broken out at Rome. <i>Martial</i> describes this admirably
in the two following Epigrams, which are of
the very highest importance in connection with our
subject:</p>


<p><i>Book XII.</i> <i>Epigram 59:</i></p>

<p>(<i>Of pestilent Kissers</i>: Rome bestows more kisses

<p>(<i>To Bassus</i>: Escape the kissers, no! it is not to
be done, Bassus. They set upon you, wait for you,
pursue you, meet you, here, there, and everywhere,
in every street, at every corner. <i>Neither acrid ulcer
nor shiny pustules, neither disfigured chin</i> nor foul
scabs, nor lips anointed with pink salve, nor the
drop at the tip of a frozen nose will save you. They
kiss a man sweating with heat and starving with cold,
nay! even a man keeping his lips pure for the nuptial
kiss. A head muffled in hoods will not exempt you,
nor a litter guarded with rug and curtain, nor the
sedan kept closed most of the time get you off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
The kisser will in by every chink. Not the very
consulship, not the tribuneship, not the stern fasces
and threatening rod of the shouting lictor will keep
away the kisser. Though you sit exalted on the
high tribunal, or give laws to the people from the
curule seat, both to one and the other the kisser
will climb up. He will kiss a man shaking with fever,
and drivelling with cold. He will give a kiss to a
man gaping, to a man swimming, even to a man
shitting! The one and only cure for the plague is
to make a real friend, whom you will not need
to kiss).</p>

<p>Now we shall be in a position to explain to our
satisfaction what <i>Martial</i> meant by <i>basia lasciva</i>
(wanton kisses),—XI. 24.—<i>basia maligna</i> (pestilent
kisses),—XII. 55.—and <i>Petronius</i> (ch. 23.) by his
<i>conspuere aliquem basio immundissimo</i> (to beslobber
anyone with a most filthy kiss); and we shall be in
no way surprised at the fact that <i>mentagra</i> not only
attacked the Roman nobles as a virtual epidemic,
but that the <i>velox transitus osculi</i> (the swift transmission
of a kiss) was alleged by Pliny as a reason
of its communication.</p>

<p>Finally as to the historical factor in connection
with <i>mentagra</i>,—it is implied in the account Pliny
gives that it was <i>only at Rome</i> it was regarded as a
new disease. It must have been already known to
the Greeks, for they possessed the name <i>Lichen</i> for
it. The Greek physicians, of whom several of the
ones quoted by <i>Galen</i> lived some considerable time
before Claudius, know nothing about the disease
being a new one, while <i>Galen</i> himself says simply,
<em class="gesperrt">ἐπικρατούσης</em> ἐν τῇ πόλει τῆς μεντάγρας
λεγομέμης, (when the <i>mentagra</i> as it was called <i>was
prevalent</i> in the city). <i>Plutarch</i> again, though he
(Symposiaca bk. VIII. Quaest. 9.) wrote a special
Chapter on new diseases, with particular reference
to Elephantiasis, never mentions <i>mentagra</i> at all. He
represents it as having been introduced into Rome
from Asia, and it was from Egypt, the <i>Genetrix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
talium vitiorum</i> (Mother-land of suchlike abominations),
the Physicians<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> were imported who understood how
to cure the disorder. We have more than once
noted that Asia was the breeding place of sexual
excesses, and described how vice spread from thence
over different countries and how as a result of these
practices the affections of the parts naturally concerned
that arose first in Asia subsequently passed on to
these same countries. For Rome this was in an
especial degree the case with Egypt, where the
undermining of morality had gone farthest; <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
spoke justly when he said “<i>Nequitias tellus scit dare
nulla magis</i>,” (No other land knows better how to
produce finished rascality). But the intercourse with
Asia and Egypt arose mainly in the time of Pompey,
and became from that period ever more active,
while concurrently luxury was on the increase and
the old Virtus (manly virtue) of the Romans disappearing
more and more every day,—above all when
Tiberius by his own example elevated every form of
vice into a sort of fancy article demanded by fashion.</p>

<p>Not that the Emperor went unpunished, for he
himself probably suffered from <i>mentagra</i>. <i>Julian</i><a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
says of him, that when Romulus had invited to the
feast of the Saturnalia all gods and Caesars, Tiberius
appeared with the rest, “but when he turned round
to take his seat, on his back could be seen in
thousands scars, marks of burnings and scrapings,
indurated weals and callosities, results of his excesses
and wild lusts, cankers and scabs as it were burnt
in”. Nay! according to <i>Suetonius</i><a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> his face itself
bore <i>crebri et subtiles tumores</i> (a multitude of minute
swellings); and <i>Tacitus</i><a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> says of him: <i>Praegracilis et
incurva proceritas, nudus capillo vertex, ulcerosa facies,
ac plerumque medicaminibus interstincta</i>, (Tall and of
a most graceful, albeit bowed, figure; the head bald,
the face covered <i>with ulcers</i>, and generally patched
with medical plasters). When <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> mentions a
τροχίσκος πρὸς ἕρπητας ὁ Τιβηρίου Καίσαρος (a
lozenge for creeping eruptions, Tiberius Caesar’s),
this does not in any way necessarily imply that this
was prescribed as a remedy against eruptive symptoms
on the <i>face</i>, for Tiberius, as we see from the passage
quoted from <i>Julian</i>, suffered from eruptions on all
the other parts of his body. Even if an affection
of the face was intended, the expression ἕρπης
(creeping eruption), in view of the marked tendency
of the disease to spread to neighbouring parts, was
not at all an unnatural one to be used; and we
may say, speaking generally, that the view which
holds the Greeks to have indicated by the word
ἕρπης any one definite and distinct form of eruption
is entirely mistaken. <i>Bertrandi</i><a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> indeed endeavours
to show that <i>mentagra</i> was a form of malignant
tetter. That the application of plasters as a remedy
in <i>mentagra</i> was frequently recommended and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
employed is shown both by <i>Galen</i> and <i>Aëtius</i><a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>.</p>

<p>But in proportion as the exciting cause grew ever
more and more common, the <i>cunnilingue</i> being now
no longer contented with girls, but employing for
the satisfaction of his shameful mania women and
even pregnant women as well, and at last actually
women during menstruation, the resulting consequences
were bound to occur not only more frequently
but also in a more dangerous form. At
first it was merely single pustules, which appeared
round the mouth and took possession of the chin,
and which were confounded with <i>Sycosis menti</i>
(Sycosis,—fig-like eruption of the chin), a complaint
liable to arise from other causes as well and one
long since familiar, without attracting particular attention
as anything uncommon. Later on when
neither morbid vaginal phlegm nor yet menstrual
blood repelled the <i>cunnilingue</i> any longer, there was
set up a diseased process in the cutaneous glands,
the resulting secretion rapidly drying formed a white
crust or scurf, and this was detached in flakes
resembling bran. All this could not fail to arouse
remark, and accordingly the Romans, little practised
in medical diagnosis, saw in it a new disease, which
in turn received a new name. Just as in more
modern times the introduction of Venereal disease
was attributed to a leprous Knight from the Holy
Land, so now at Rome <i>Perusinus, eques Romanus,
Quaestorius scriba</i> (Perusinus, a Roman knight, a
secretary in the Quaestorian office) was held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
responsible for bringing <i>mentagra</i> from Asia. As
a matter of fact he probably got his <i>mentagra</i>
in Asia in exactly the same manner in which it was
acquired in Rome,—if indeed we are on general
grounds to give any weight to this part of the story.
At any rate modern times have given us many examples
of how much credence mankind is ready to
give to an account of the introduction of a disease
by one definite individual. But the disease did not
stop at the cutaneous glands, the hair-glands were
also involved, the hair fell away, and ulcers formed,
which spread around with destructive virulence, as
was particularly the case in Martial’s day. On the
other hand it is true deep-seated ulceration never
supervened, but the disease rather extended on the
surface from the face onwards, spreading more or
less over the whole of the rest of the body<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>, and
thus assumed the form of Psora (Itch) or Lepra
(Leprosy),—a phænomenon we shall have to return
to once more later, its right appreciation being of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
utmost importance for the History of Venereal Disease.</p>

<p>Now, since on the one hand every <i>cunnilingue</i> is
not attacked by <i>mentagra</i>, while on the other sometimes
ulcers of the inner portion of the mouth,
sometimes <i>mentagra</i>, and the latter sometimes local,
sometimes of wide extent, are noted, the following
question calls for an answer. What circumstances
conditioned these phænomena and, generally, the
special frequency of <i>mentagra</i> in Italy? Leaving
out of account a variety of other considerations, we
are bound in this place to call in along with other
factors of our explanation some special and particular
influence of the <i>Genius epidemicus</i> (the aggregate of
epidemical conditions at large), which just at that
time favoured the rise of skin complaints. However
slight the material Antiquity affords us on this point,
and especially so far as concerns the time a little
before and after Our Lord’s birth, still we <i>do</i> find
a datum for Italy at any rate which we certainly
ought not to leave unutilized. This is the statement
of <i>Pliny</i> (ch. 5. and Bk. XX. ch. 52.) to the effect
that it was in the time of Pompey the Great, or
according to <i>Plutarch</i> (loco citato) in that of Asclepiades,
that <i>elephantiasis</i> first showed itself in Italy.
It follows that at that period favourable external
circumstances also were in existence in connection
with the conditions of disease at large,—as indeed the
ready extension of <i>mentagra</i> from the chin onwards
to the rest of the body proves even more clearly.</p>

<p>But it must not for a moment be supposed that
therefore <i>mentagra</i> was of <i>epidemic origin</i>. Without
at all wishing to embark on the consideration of the
ætiological factors of <i>elephantiasis</i>, we may just mention
the fact that according to Pliny’s account this
disease too, equally with <i>mentagra</i>, would seem to
have always begun with the <i>face</i><a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>. The conjecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
is all but unavoidable, that very possibly in either
case it was the practices of the <i>cunnilingue</i> that
supplied the exciting cause for the misfortune; and
this would also probably explain how it was <i>elephantiasis</i>
came to be connected in men’s minds with
the <i>Morbus phoeniceus</i> (Phoenician disease). Still,
as already explained, this would only be equivalent
to making it responsible in <i>individual</i> cases,—cases
that tend inevitably to render the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
understanding of the action of <i>elephantiasis</i>, as well as of
its history, considerably more difficult. May it not
also be to some extent the case that under the
general name of <i>elephantiasis</i> forms of disease of
very different sorts have been confounded? The
views held by the Ancients on this and on the other
skin diseases still remain in too much obscurity for
anyone to be able to give a decisive judgement on
the point. For the rest most probably the <i>atra lues</i>
and <i>scelerata lues</i> (black contagion, abominable contagion),
spoken of above, likewise come under
the category of <i>mentagra</i>. This we have felt
ourselves constrained to ascribe not solely to the
practise of the vice of the <i>cunnilingue</i> as a cause,
but to <i>fellation</i> also,—only that in the latter case,
as we have pointed out, it is rather the inner, in
the former rather the external parts, that became
affected.</p>

<small>(Campanian Disease).<br />

§ 26.</small></h4>

<p>Several of the commentators on <i>Horace</i>, and particularly
<i>Laevinus Torrentius</i><a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> have referred the much-discussed
<i>Morbus Campanus</i><a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> to the head of <i>mentagra</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
accordingly this will be no inappropriate place at
any rate to mention it, though without aiming at a
complete explanation. <i>Horace</i> represents two buffoons,
<i>Messius</i> and <i>Sarmentus</i>, as rallying each other for
the amusement of the company:</p>

<p>(Messius was sprung of the renowned race of the
Oscans, Sarmentus’mistress is yet living; from these
ancestors derived, they came to the fray. First
begins Sarmentus: “I declare you are just like an
unbroken horse.” At this sally we laugh, and Messius
himself says: “I accept the likeness,” and tosses his
head. “Oh! if your horn had not been amputated
from your brow,” says he then, “what <i>would</i> you
do, since you threaten us so fiercely, mutilated as
you are?” Now an ugly scar disfigured the left
side of his shaggy brow. After making a number
of jibes at his <i>Campanian disease</i>, and his face, he
asked him to dance the shepherd Cyclops; saying
there needed no mask and tragic buskins. Many
jests Cicirrus added as well).</p>

<p>Messius who is chiefly spoken of in the above
passage, is in the first place represented as an Oscan
by birth. Now the whole race of the Oscans was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
as <i>Festus</i> informs us, notorious for its unnatural
excesses in matters of Love; we read in him, p. 191:
“<em class="gesperrt">Obscum</em> duas diversas et contrarias significationes
habet. Nam Cloatius putat eo vocabulo significari
sacrum, quo etiam leges sacrae Oscae dicuntur, et
in omnibus fere antiquis commentariis scribitur
<em class="gesperrt">Opicum</em> pro Obsco, ut in Titini fabula quinta:
Qui Obsce et Volsce fabulantur, nam Latine nesciunt.
A quo etiam verba impudentia, et elata appellantur
obscena, <em class="gesperrt">quia frequentissimus fuit usus
Oscis libidinum spurcarum</em>.” (<i>Obscum</i> has
two different and contrary meanings. For Cloatius
considers <i>sacred</i> to be signified by the word, in which
sense sacred laws are spoken of as leges Oscae
(<i>Oscan</i> laws), and in almost all the old commentaries
<i>Opicum</i> is written for <i>Obscum</i>, as in the fifth Fable
of Titinius: “Who converse in <i>Obscan</i> and Volscian,
because they know not how in Latin.” Whence
also indecent words, and swelling ones, are called
<i>obscene, because the practice of unclean lusts was most
frequent among the Oscans</i><a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>.)</p>

<p>Again on p. 194., “Oscos, quos dicimus, ait Verrius
Opscos ante dictos, teste Ennio, cum dicat: De
muris res gerit Opscus. Adiicit etiam, quod <em class="gesperrt">stupra
inconcessae libidinis obscena dicantur,
ab eius gentis consuetudine inducta</em>.
Quod verum esse non satis adducor, cum apud
antiquos omnes fere obscena dicta sint, quae mali
ominis habebantur.” (The <i>Oscans</i>, as we call them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Verrius says were formerly called <i>Opscans</i>, on the
evidence of Ennius, for he says: “The Opscan
directs his attack upon the walls.” He adds further
that <i>debaucheries of lawless love are called “obscene”, as
taking this name from the habits of the nation in question</i>.
But I am not sufficiently convinced of the truth of
this, inasmuch as in nearly all the ancient writers
things are called <i>obscene</i> that were held to be of evil
omen). However what the <i>spurca libido</i> (unclean lust)
consisted in may be readily conjectured from the
following explanations of <i>Festus</i>: <i>Oscines aves</i> Appius
Claudius esse ait, quae <i>ore canentes</i> faciant auspicium,
ut <i>corvus</i><a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>, cornix, noctua, (Divinatory birds—<i>Oscines</i>
aves—are, says Appius Claudius, such as give an
augury by <i>singing with the mouth</i>, as <i>the raven</i>, the
crow, the owl); if only we remember how the <i>fellator</i>,
as was shown on a previous page, was nicknamed
<i>corvus</i> (raven). Again in an Epigram of <i>Ausonius</i>
already quoted a <i>cunnilingue</i> is called <i>Opicus magister</i>;
so that we cannot doubt the question is here
of that vice which is practised with the mouth.</p>

<p>In another Epigram of <i>Ausonius</i> quoted and
explained above, where the different forms of the
<i>obscoena Venus</i> (obscene Love) are specified, Crispa
there mentioned practises,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse"><i>Et quam Nolanis capitalis luxus inussit</i>,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(That vice too which headlong wantonness branded
on the men of Nola), and this <i>capitalis luxus</i><a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
the men of Nola, as the general sense of the whole
passage clearly shows, is nothing else but <i>fellation</i>.
But the town of Nola was in Campania, and the
inhabitants of Campania again consisted for the most
part of Oscans; so whatever is true of the latter,
must needs also apply to the Campanians. The
Nolans and Oscans or Opicans being <i>fellators</i> and
<i>cunnilingues</i>, the Campanians must be so too; and
as a matter of fact <i>Plautus</i> (Trinum. II. 4. 144.)
tells us: <i>Campas genus multo Syrorum antidit
patientia</i>, (The Campanian race far outdoes that of
the Syrians in <i>passivity</i>).</p>

<p>Now Messius being represented as an Oscan, and
this by way of mockery, as all expounders admit,
the point of the jest must evidently refer to this
<i>luxus capitalis</i>, and Messius accordingly be regarded
as a <i>fellator</i>. Now let us look if this view finds any
confirmation in what follows<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>. First of all Sarmentus
says Messius is <i>equi feri similis</i> (like an unbroken
horse). Wherein precisely the satire of this consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
is indeed somewhat doubtful, the commentators
maintaining an obstinate silence on the point; but
there <i>must</i> be some allusion of some sort intended.
We can scarcely suppose this to be to the <i>Hectoreus
equus</i> (the Hectorean stallion) of Ovid<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> or the <i>equus
supinus</i> (the stallion lying supine) of Horace,—Sat.
II. 7. 50.<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>. The unbroken horse is noticeable as
galloping with head down between the fore-feet, a
position taken, as we have already pointed out,
by the <i>cunnilingue</i>, but which in accordance with
the passage of Lucian quoted above can equally
well be that of the <i>fellator</i><a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>. Messius must have
understood the allusion, for he says, “<i>Accipio</i>”,—<i>caput
et movet</i>, (“I accept”,—and moves his head).
Sarmentus takes the movement as a threat, for he
in his turn understands the <i>equus ferus</i> (wild horse)
in yet another sense as <i>aries</i> (a ram)<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>, and adds:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
If only your horn had not been amputated! What
should make you threaten to butt, <i>mutilus</i> (mutilated)<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
as you are?</p>

<p>Now in explanation of what it was led Sarmentus
to indulge in this jest, Horace goes on to say that
Messius carried on the left side of his brow a hideous
scar. At this Sarmentus directs his wit, making
allusion to the <i>Campanus morbus</i> (Campanian disease)
and Messius’disfigured face, finishing up by asking
the latter <i>pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa</i> (to dance the
shepherd Cyclops), adding that for this he would
need neither mask nor tragic buskins. But the
<i>Campanus morbus</i><a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> is indeed nothing else but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
<i>capitalis luxus</i> (headlong wantonness) of the Nolans,
the peculiar vice of the Oscans, <i>fellation</i> in fact,
which Messius practised, and to which he owed his
<i>foeda cicatrix</i> (hideous scar), his disfigured face;
and on both these points Sarmentus proceeds to
rally him at great length (<i>permulta iocatus</i>,—indulging
in very many jests), without Horace however recording
his wit any further. In the <i>pastorem Cyclopa saltare</i>
(to dance the shepherd Cyclops) again is contained
an allusion that has hitherto been quite misunderstood,
one which <i>Lucian</i> in his Pseudologistae (ch. 27.)
will best explain for us. He says to Timarchus:
“But in Italy, great gods! you acquired the
heroic nickname of ὁ Κύκλωψ (the Cyclops),
because at one time you wanted to practise
your vice in imitation of the old legend, as it is
found in <i>Homer</i>, and actually, as you lay there
drunk, held the κισσύβιον (wassail-bowl) in your
hand like a wanton Polyphemus; and the young
man hired for the purpose with outstretched <i>hasta</i>
(spear), that was well sharpened, threw himself upon
you like another Odysseus, to thrust out your eye<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Yet did he miss his aim, and the spear turned slantwise beside you;</div>
  <div class="verse">So that its point sped past, the edge of your chin merely grazing.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>
<p>Thus it is by no means unreasonable to speak of
you as using “cold-mouthed phrases” (Ψυχρολογεῖν).
But you, Cyclops, opening your mouth, and gaping
as wide as mortal man can, had your cheeks plugged
by him, or better you longed, as Charybdis with the
ships was fain to swallow down helm and sail and
all, you longed to absorb the whole Οὖτις (No-man).”</p>

<p>Finally the nickname Messius bears, <i>Cicirrus</i> or
<i>Cicerrus</i>, would seem to embody a jesting allusion,
as it was no doubt given him on account of
his throaty, croaking voice. It signifies the same
thing as κερκίδες (hawks) in Dio Chrysostom,
and like that word is to be derived from κέρχω
(to croak)<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Morbus Phoeniceus</i> (Phoenician disease) was
not, as we have seen, elephantiasis at all, and neither
was the <i>Morbus Campanus</i> (Campanian disease)
mentagra. But just as elephantiasis might supervene
as a consequence of <i>Morbus Phoeniceus</i>, so the <i>foeda
cicatrix</i> (hideous scar), a mark left behind it by a
previous malady, was a consequence of the <i>Morbus
Campanus</i>. Now what was the nature of this malady
that the mark it left behind showed as a <i>foeda
cicatrix</i>, is precisely what we would wish to determine.
The Commentators all take the <i>cornu exsectum</i>
(a horn amputated) as giving the explanation, though
this is by no means absolutely necessary according
to the general drift of the passage as explained;
and Sarmentus might perfectly well under these
circumstances, arguing from the presence of a scar,
assume or at any rate profess to assume as the cause
from which this had originated, the previous existence
of a horny excrescence, without the latter as an
actual matter of fact having ever had any previous
existence. To us at any rate the <i>cornu exsectum</i>
appears to stand in only a remote connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the <i>foeda cicatrix</i>, which was no doubt later on made
the subject of manifold further witticisms; only
Horace has given us no more details about the matter,
either because they had entirely escaped his memory,
or possibly because he had not perfectly grasped
the point of these jokes. Certainly the conspicuously
placed <i>at</i> (but) seems to point to a distinction of what
follows from what precedes—unless indeed it is so
placed merely to mark the transition from the <i>oratio
directa</i> to the <i>oratio indirecta</i>.</p>

<p>However, granted there actually was an excrescence
previously existing, which had been removed
by the knife, of what nature was the said excrescence?
It is scarcely possible, with Heindorf, to
suppose the Satyriasis of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> to be intended
here; with much greater probability <i>Schneider</i> in his
Greek Dictionary, under the word διονυσιακὸς
(Dionysiac, connected with Dionysus) drew attention
to the definition of <i>Galen</i> (edit. Kühn XIX. p. 443.):
διονυσίσκοι εἰσὶν ὀστώδεις ὑπεροχαὶ ἐγγὺς κροτάφων
γιγνόμεναι. λέγονται δὲ κέρατα ἀπὸ τῶν
κερασφορούντων ζάων κεκλημένα. (διονυσίσκοι
are bony excrescences growing near the temples,
and they are called horns, so named from the
animals that carry horns). A passage of <i>Heliodorus</i>
(<i>Cocchi Ant., Graecorum chirurgici libri, e collect.
Nicetae Florent.</i> 1754. fol., p. 125.) which <i>Oribasius,
De fracturis</i>, has preserved, gives a slightly different
account; it reads: Ὀστώδης ἐπίφυσις ἐν παντὶ μὲν
γίγνεται μέρει τοῦ σώματος, πλεοναζόντως δὲ ἐ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>ν
τῇ κεφαλῇ, μάλιστα δὲ πλησίον τῶν κροτάφων·
Ὅταν δὲ δύο ἐπιφύσεις γένωνται πλησιάζουσαι
τοῖς κροτάφοις, κέρατα ταῦτα τινες εἴωθασιν
ὀνομάζειν, ἔνιοι δὲ <em class="gesperrt">διονυσιακοὺς</em> τοὺς οὕτω
πεπονθότας ἀνθρώπους προσηγόρευσαν. (Bony
outgrowth may occur in every part of the body, but
pre-eminently on the head, and particularly near
the temples. But when there are two such growths
in the neighbourhood of the temples, some are wont
to call them <i>horns</i>, but others name the patients so
afflicted διονυσιακοὶ). Then follows the description
of the outgrowth, and the method of its removal
by excision. On this passage <i>Cocchi</i> found an old
marginal gloss from the hand of Nicotas (?), κέρατα
μὲν λέγεται ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν κεράτων ἐκφύσεως, τῶν
γιγνομένων τοῖς ἀλόγοις ζώοις. <em class="gesperrt">Διονυσιακοὺς</em>
δὲ αὐτοὺς προσαγορεύουσιν, ἀπὸ τῆς πρὸς τὸν
θεὸν ἐμφερείας <em class="gesperrt">ὡς αὐτός</em> φησιν ἐν τοῖς χειρουργουμένοις,—(they
are called horns from the
growth of the horns that appear on the lower
animals. And they name them διονυσιακοὶ from
the likeness to the god Dionysus, as he says himself,
in the carved figures),—which on the whole
confirms the statement of Heliodorus, though he
(Cocchi) prefers, following this indication, to
emend the passage of Galen also so as to read,
διονυσιακοί, <em class="gesperrt">οἷς</em> ὀστώδεις ὑπεροχαὶ ἐγγὺς κροτάφων
<em class="gesperrt">γίγνονται</em>, (Dionysiaci, so they are called,
i.e. those in whom bony excrescences grow near
the temples). This much, that we should read
διονυσιακοὶ for διονυσίσκοι, is evident, but whether
the rest of the emendations are to be accepted may
well be open to doubt, as the second clause of the
sentence, “and they are called κέρατα (horns), so
named from the animals that carry horns”, obviously
implies that the term διονυσιακοὶ is used in reference
not to the individual, but to the outgrowth.
Schneider indeed agrees with the emendation of
Cocchi, but has in error put Sarmentus in the place
of Messius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Now supposing the latter has actually had an
earlier bony outgrowth, it is not exactly evident why
after its skilful removal a <i>foeda cicatrix</i> (hideous scar)
should have remained,—if indeed we do not prefer
to regard the <i>foedus</i> (hideous, foul) as perhaps pointing
to the <i>cause</i> that had occasioned the outgrowth in
question. In that case it would certainly be interesting
to see thus referred to the vice of the <i>fellator</i>
affections of the bones carrying the same meaning
as our own tophi (concretions on the bone in
gouty affections). But in all probability it was
merely cutaneous tubercles that had been removed
by surgical means, the actual cautery or the knife,
and these, as is invariably their nature to do, had left
behind an ugly scar. Thus Messius would seem to
have resembled Calvus <i>tuberossimae frontis</i> (with brow
most thickly covered with tubercles) in Petronius
(ch. 15.) and the face represented on a gem, of
which a delineation is said to be found in <i>Corius’</i>

<p>In the various forms of vice hitherto considered
we have seen mankind approximating more and more
closely to the animal and putting himself to a greater
or less degree on the same footing; now we behold
him in <i>Sodomy</i><a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> sinking finally far <i>below</i> the level
of the animal, renouncing not merely the human but
even the animal nature, in virtue of which he has
been able so far to call himself at lowest a member
of the species. So it is with complete justice that
<i>Plutarch</i><a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> “At gallus si gallum conscendat
absente gallina, vivus comburitur, aruspice aliquo
pronuntiante grave atroxque id esse ostentum. Ita
ipsi homines hoc confessi sunt, castitate a brutis
se superari, eaque naturae vim non facere voluptatum
percipiendarum causa. Vestras libidines natura,
quamquam legis auxilio fulta, tamen intra suos non
potest coercere fines: quin eae instar fluvii exundantes
atrocem foeditatem, tumultum confusionemque
naturae gignant in re venerea. Nam et capras,
porcas, equas iniverunt viri, et feminae insano
mascularum bestiarum amore exarserunt. Ex huiusmodi
enim coitibus vobis sunt Minotauri, Silvani
seu Aegipanes atque (ut mea fert sententia) etiam
Sphinges et Centauri nati[136]. Enimvero fame coactus
canis aut avis aliquando cadavere humano vescitur;
ad coitum nullus unquam est homo a bestia sollicitatus,
bestias vero cum ad hanc, tum ad alias
voluptates vos vi trahitis ac contra jus usurpatis.”
(But if the cock tread the cock in the absence of
the hen, he is burned alive, any augur pronouncing
this to be a serious and sinister prodigy.
Thus men have themselves admitted that they are
surpassed by brutes in chastity, and that the latter
do not do violence to nature with a view to the
gratification of their desires. Whereas your lusts
nature cannot, though seconded by the aid of law,
restrain within their due bounds, or stay them from
overflowing like a river in flood and producing horrid
abominations, a wild cataclysm and confusion of
nature in matters of love. For men have had intercourse
with she-goats and sows and mares, while
women have been inflamed with mad love of male
beasts. Indeed it is from such unions that your
Minotaurs have been engendered, and Silvani or
Aegipans, and—as I suppose,—the Sphinxes too and
Centaurs<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>. True under compulsion of hunger, dog
and bird sometimes feed on a human corpse; but
no man has ever been invited to coition by any
beast, though you constrain beasts by force to this
as well as to other shameful pleasures, and use them
contrary to all right).</p>

<p>Like all other forms of vicious lust, Sodomy too
was an outcome of Asiatic<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> and Egyptian luxury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and already in quite early times familiar in those
regions,—in fact, as is the case with sexual excesses
generally, this vice appears to have developed from
the religious cult of the countries named. Among
the Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> at any rate we meet with Mendes,
the sacred Goat or Pan, worshipped by means of
Sodomy on the part of his female devotees, who
were shut up along with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p><i>Boettiger</i><a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> goes so far as to conjecture that the
tame snakes in the temple of Aesculapius, which
were also kept in private houses<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> as a plaything of
the women, were trained and employed by them
for purposes of Sodomy. In confirmation a passage
is brought forward in this connection by <i>Forberg</i>,
loco citato, p. 368, from <i>Suetonius</i><a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>, in which the
mother of Augustus, Atia, is spoken of: “In Asclepiadis
Mendetis Θεολογουμένων libris lego, Atiam
cum ad sollemne Apollinis sacrum media nocte
venisset, posita in templo lectica, dum ceterae
matronae dormirent, obdormisse; draconem repente
irrepsisse ad eam paulloque post egressum: illamque
expergefactam <em class="gesperrt">quasi a concubitu mariti
purificasse se</em> et statim in corpore eius
exstitisse maculam, velut depicti draconis, nec
potuisse unquam eximi, adeo ut mox publicis balneis
perpetuo abstinuerit”<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>. (In the books of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
<i>Theologoumena</i> (sacred writings) of the Asclepiad
Mendes I read how Atia, who had come to the
wonted festival of Apollo at midnight, when her litter
had been set down in the Temple, and the other
matrons were sleeping, herself fell asleep; how a snake
suddenly crept in to her, and presently emerged
again; and how on waking she <i>purified herself as
after intercourse with her husband</i>, and immediately
there appeared a mark on her body, representing
the likeness of a snake, which could never be got
rid of, so much so that soon she left off ever after
frequenting the public baths).</p>

<p>However the Roman women seem to have especially
made use of the ass<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> for the satisfaction of their
<i>nymphomania</i>, an animal that was famed in Antiquity
for its salaciousness.</p>

<p>That under such circumstances the women’s genitals,
and the men’s no less, were exposed to many sorts
of injury, may be readily supposed; though we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
sought in vain so far for any direct evidence of the
fact. So we may perhaps be allowed to quote here
an observation originating with <i>Abu Oseibah</i>, De
vitis medicorum illustrium, (On the Lives of Famous
Physicians), according to <i>Reiske</i><a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>. This properly
speaking belongs to a later period chronologically,
but it is pertinent in the present connection. Reiske
says: “Caput XIII. habet observationem—2. de
ingenti <em class="gesperrt">penis inflammatione, quae nata
fuerat ex impuro cum bestia concubitu</em>,
cum coruncula urethram obstruente,
sanata modo prorsum empirico atque crudeli. Impositum
glabro lapidi penem medicus subito praeter
aegri expectationem, qua poterat vi percutiebat
manu in pugnum coacta, ut obturaculum et ulcus
dissiliret. Sapit hic casus <em class="gesperrt">luem veneream</em>;
et posset inservire illis pro argumento, qui morbum
hunc etiam veteribus cognitum fuisse contendunt.
Cadit autem is casus circa annum Christi 940.”
(Chapter XIII contains the following observation,—2.
Of a violent <i>inflammation of the penis, which had
originated in unclean intercourse with a beast</i>, with a
coruncle, or knot, constricting the urethra, cured in
a manner to the last degree empirical and cruel.
The penis being laid on a rough stone, the Physician
suddenly when the patient was not expecting it, struck
it as heavily as ever he could with his doubled fist,
so that the stoppage and ulcer might burst. This
case has a smack of the <i>Venereal disease</i> about it; and
might serve as an argument for those who hold that
this disease was known to the Ancients as well. But
the case falls about the year of Our Lord 940.)</p>

<small>§ 28.</small></h3>

<p>Now that we have made ourselves acquainted with
the various use to which the Ancients put the genital
organs, we are confronted inevitably with the question,—how
were the genitals themselves affected by
it all? Impossible to suppose they can have preserved
their integrity absolutely intact, while at the same
time such parts as were substituted in use for the
one or the other form of them, were exposed,—as
is abundantly proved by the different diseases
described, diseases affecting the <i>pathic</i>, the <i>fellator</i>
and the <i>cunnilingue</i> respectively,—to manifold complaints,
and very often had to pay severely for the
misuse to which they were put. Granting that the
unnatural use of the mouth and the rectum must
necessarily have endangered those parts specifically
more than the penis, an organ particularly adapted
and intended for friction, still this will by no means
imply the entire immunity of the latter from ill
effects. Indeed the fact of such immunity is sufficiently
disproved by the passages quoted specifically
under paederastia, without taking into account
at all the large number of actual maladies of the
genitals that are mentioned by professional and
non-professional writers of Antiquity. With some
of these we have already made acquaintance,—maladies
which no one would for a moment think
of ascribing <i>exclusively</i> to the practice of the vice of
paederastia.</p>

<p>Accordingly we must look for other factors, which
being in part unconnected with the use of the
genitals, are not like this to be regarded as an
immediately efficient cause, but rather as predisposing
circumstances, exercising from the first an independent
influence on the normal condition of those organs.
For mere use or misuse cannot possibly be taken
as in itself a sufficient reason to account for disease,
even though the Ancients may have looked upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
complaints of the genitals partly as a direct consequence
of <i>illicita Venus</i> (unlawful Love), or in other
words as it were a result of the vengeance of outraged
Nature. The genitals, like all organs of the human
body, exhibit over and above their functional activity
on behalf of the general organism and its reproduction,
evidences also of an independent activity directed
towards the maintenance of their own integrity and
individual existence,—and these are bound to differ
more or less according to difference of locality and
difference of time, as indeed may be predicated of
the organism as a whole, if we trust the indications
it gives.</p>

<p>Now this differentiation according to locality is
conditioned above all else by climate; hence the
question we have now first of all to answer is this:
<i>what influence did climate manifest in Ancient times
on the activity of the genital organs in general and in
particular?</i> and, <i>to what extent may a factor favourable
to the rise of affections of the genitals be deduced
from it?</i> True, direct information on the point has
so far reached us only sparingly, still such as we
have is enough to justify a general view on the
whole question, especially if we reinforce it with the
results of more recent observation,—always provided
this be done with proper precaution, for we sometimes
find the Ancients commending the climate of
a particular country as being exceedingly healthy,
whereas in more modern times exactly the opposite
is noted. As the evidence extant and available
extends only to Asia, and in particular Syria,
Palestine and Asia Minor, to Egypt, Greece and
Italy, there can for the present be no question except
as to the climate of these countries.</p>

<p>Next as to <i>the influence of sexual activity in general</i>,
<i>Hippocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> himself tells us, after discussing the
climate of Asia:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> “But ἡδονή (pleasure) must necessarily
predominate (among them), and this is why
among animals so many varieties are found; and I
suppose this to be equally true in the case of the
Egyptians and Lydians also.” Of course ἡδονή in
this passage signifies concupiscence in particular;—no
special proof is needed of this. As a matter of
fact we observe at the present day how in hot
climates, where the whole vegetative life presents a
luxuriant character, and all Nature appears to feel
the procreative impulse unceasingly, man too falls
in with the universal stress and strain of each species
to maintain its foothold. Yet as this must inevitably
be done at the expense of the individual life, we
see the effort very frequently resulting in the production
of barren or sexless blossoms, and not fruit at
all. The son of the South is like a tree growing in
rich, rank soil; he ripens betimes to the sexual life,
but equally early is constrained to abandon it again.
The youthful imagination springs up in its fresh
quick activity, while the body withers concurrently,
and stung by lust,—lust that is yet further exaggerated
by the misuse of <i>aphrodisiacs</i>, at last has nothing
left but to drag out an invalid existence, finding a
morbid gratification in the artificial ways and means
whereby imagination, sickened and debauched by its
own extravagances, seeks to supply from extraneous
sources the failing titillation of desire the organ
craves. No better confirmation of all this can be
found than what is supplied already in our investigations
as so far conducted.</p>

<p>We saw how in Asia lust and its abominable
brood arose and extended thence over neighbouring
lands, and how the rhythmic rites of the <i>Venus
ebria</i> (drunken Venus) could indeed refine, but hardly
increase their excesses. Babylon, Syria and Egypt
were the nurseries of licentiousness, finding only at
Rome a really self-taught and competent rival. The
clear sky of Greece could cover only inhabitants of
corresponding character in body and mind, and
none but a Greek was capable of setting up the
ideal, and verifying it in practice, of a fair soul in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
a fair body. Deep as the Greek may have sunk
in degradation after the fall of national liberty and
under foreign influence, and though unbridled lust
may have often mastered individuals, it never
dominated the nation as a whole, it was artificially
brought into existence and was never dependent on
climate. Even at Rome, colossal as was the scale
on which vice manifested itself, it ever remained
but a foreign importation, for which foreign wantons
had first paved the way at a period when the
climate of Asia exerted a more immediate influence
there than that of Greece.</p>

<p>Like licentiousness in general, Polygamy also, in
part owing its existence to it as it does, was a
consequence of the Asiatic climate; but how far it
may be fairly held to have influenced the rise of
Venereal disease, we do not as yet venture to decide;
we feel constrained to keep this point over for later
investigations. The same applies to Polyandry,—in
its strict sense, when we regard it as a form of
marriage; though of course over and above this it
comes into connection with vice, inasmuch as every
prostitute lives in a state of Polyandry, as does
every amateur of the sex in one of Polygamy. Under
these circumstances affections of the genitals cannot
but arise among persons otherwise healthy, as every
Physician of large practice can verify by examples,
and as experiments on animals have sufficiently
demonstrated to be the case<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>. Nevertheless these
hints, for we cannot and ought not to look upon
them as anything more than hints, as any more
complete discussion would carry us too far a-field
for our present purpose,—may very well suffice to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
recall to the reader’s memory the influence exerted
by climate on the genital functions, especially as
adequate proofs in confirmation of all this are
comprised in our preceding Sections.</p>


<h4>§ 29.</h4>

<p>Far more important in view of our immediate
object is the <i>influence exerted by Climate on the
individual activity of the genital organs</i>, and here
again we have in the first place to fix our eyes on
Asia and Egypt. The burning rays of the sun to
which these regions and their inhabitants are exposed,
increase in a marked way the activity of the skin,
and of course in the same proportion do the secretions
from the mucous surfaces become less in quantity,
but their product more highly charged in quality.
Then, this being the case, a certain acridity or
corroding quality of the secretion is readily set up,
often making itself noticeable by a characteristic
smell. This same influence must equally manifest
itself in the mucous membrane of the inner parts
of the genitals, and vaginal mucus accordingly acquire
an acrid quality<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>, if it is not removed pretty frequently
from the surface of the membrane, and
becoming as it were rancid, exert a corrosive effect
on everything it comes in contact with<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>Now shortly before as well as shortly after the
commencement of menstruation the secretion of
mucus in the genitals is increased, and thus the
menstrual blood, having in any case a tendency to
decomposition, will mingle with this acrid, strong-smelling
mucous discharge, and in this way assume
a foul, acrid character itself<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>. This is the origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of the ill repute into which menstrual blood, and
this especially in hot climates, has fallen from the
earliest times onwards, for no doubt the virulent
qualities alleged against it really belong to it solely
and entirely as a result of the admixture with it of
this vaginal mucus. Sea-water and fresh river-water
are each of them separately innocuous for health,
but mix them together so as to make brackish water,
and the exhalations given off become highly detrimental!</p>

<p>A similar state of things exists also in connection
with the male genital organs. The surface of the
<i>glans penis</i>, where it lies contiguous to the external
skin, exhibits along with the latter an increased
secretion from the sebaceous follicles<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>, the discharge
from which, if it is allowed to remain any length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of time between the prepuce and the <i>glans</i><a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>, likewise
acquires an acrid quality; then re-acting on these
parts, sets up an inflammatory condition of the aforesaid
sebaceous follicles. “In fact”, says <i>Niebuhr</i><a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
“the Medical Officer of the English at Haleb (Russel)
ascertained that in hot countries more copious
humours collect about the <i>glans penis</i> than in cold;
and a friend of mine in India, who in that hot
climate had employed only the ordinary European
precautions to ensure cleanliness, got a sort of ulcers
on the <i>glans</i>, an inconvenience he would have been
much more likely to escape, had he been circumcised.
Subsequently he always washed this part of his
person very carefully, and from that time forth
experienced no trace of a recurrence of the trouble.
Washing the whole body and particularly the privates
is an absolute necessity in hot countries; and it is
perhaps for this reason that the religious founders
of the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Fire-Worshippers,
the Heathen in India, etc., have commanded the
observation of this practice.”</p>

<p>In close accord with this is the story <i>Flavius
Josephus</i><a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> relates of <i>Apion</i> the Egyptian:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> “Wherefore
it appears to me Apion deservedly paid a fitting
penalty for his scorn of ancestral customs; for only
when forced by necessity was he circumcised,
ulceration having been set up about his privates (his
<i>glans penis</i>); and as a matter of fact the circumcision
proved vain, for gangrene supervened, and he died
in terrible pain.” Again the passage just quoted will
also afford a clear understanding of the following
from <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>:</p>

<p>“Therefore were it more becoming, quitting childish
and frivolous mockery altogether, intelligently and
earnestly to investigate the causes in which this
custom (Circumcision) originated, rather than to
accuse whole nations of folly in a spirit of mere
prejudice. It certainly does not seem probable to
an intelligent enquirer, approaching the question in
this mood, that so many thousands of folk in every
age should have been circumcised without a sufficient
cause, submitting to great pain merely to mutilate
their own and their children’s bodies. On the other
hand there are many inducements to adopt outright
and follow up the custom of our forefathers; and
in an especial degree the four following. First, <i>the
prevention of a virulent disease and one very difficult
to cure</i>. This is known as <i>Anthrax</i>,—a denomination
derived, as I suppose, from the ardent (fierce)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
burning (ἀπὸ τοῦ καίειν ἐντυφόμενον) that accompanies
it, and <i>readily arises in such as have the
foreskin intact</i>. Secondly, to secure that purity of
the whole person obligatory upon the Priestly caste.
Whence it comes that the Priests in Egypt also
scrupulously shave the whole body; for there is
something collects and is deposited underneath the
hair as well as under the foreskin, that must be
removed.”</p>

<p>From a comparison of these two passages from
Niebuhr and from Philo respectively it may be
gathered that the <i>anthrax</i> disease above mentioned
did not in any way owe its rise to a <i>specifically</i>
syphilitic origin, as has been now and again assumed
by different enquirers. What we really learn from
them is to recognize the liability of the sebaceous
follicles of the <i>glans penis</i> to lapse into a condition
of ulceration. True this tendency can be minimised
to some extent by circumcision, as well as by
unremitting care to secure cleanliness; yet it can
never be completely removed, conditioned as it
really is by climatic influences that do not admit
of elimination. When once the corroding vaginal
mucus of the woman, particularly in combination with
the menstrual blood with its readiness to undergo
putrefaction<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> re-acting on the mucous membrane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
has set up sores and ulcers, then follows as a necessary
consequence a still more dangerous mixture of
matter and mucus. Next when under these conditions
the man’s <i>glans</i>, possessing as it does an equally
great liability in its cutaneous glands to be attacked
by ulceration, enters in coition a vagina in this
state, it cannot occasion much surprise if blennorhoea
of the urethra or ulceration of the <i>glans penis</i>
supervene<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>, especially if we consider the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the act of coition sets the organs concerned in
enhanced activity, making them more susceptible
than ever to external injurious irritations. This is
yet more likely to be the case, as concurrently a
large amount of secretion is yielded by the morbidly
affected mucous surface of the vagina, and very
possibly this secretion undergoes under the influence
of nervous excitation (as the saliva does under the
influence of anger) some vital-chemical, contagious
alteration of composition. Again supposing the woman
to be at the time of coition actually in menstruation,
a period when her genital organs are <i>ipso facto</i>
roused to a condition of exaggerated activity, the
disturbance must be yet greater, and the mischief
resulting even more manifest.</p>

<p>This will in part account for the fact that ulcers
on the genitals, brought about by coition, are so
ready in Asia to assume a putrid character, and
show that the Ancients had good reason to designate
them by the name ἄνθραξ (anthrax, malignant
pustule). For that ἄνθραξ was actually a consequence
of coition we may see from a passage, already cited
by Hensler and Simon, from Bishop <i>Palladius</i><a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
relates of a certain Hero, how the Demon led him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
to Alexandria, how he there visited theatres and horse-races,
and roamed round the taverns. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
thus, being by this time a glutton and a drunkard,
he <i>fell moreover into the mire of lust after women</i>;
and being now set upon sinning, <i>he lived with a
certain actress</i>, (and had carnal intercourse with her?).
<i>Then when he had done all this, by a (Divine) providence
he got an “anthrax” on the glans penis; and was so
sick for six months that his (private) parts rotted away
and dropped off of themselves.</i> But subsequently
recovering and getting off with the loss of these
members, coming to a knowledge of God and a
remembrance of the heavenly kingdom, and after
confessing all that had befallen him, he fell asleep
a few days afterwards, without having had the time
to manifest works (of repentance).” In spite of the
difficulties some of the expressions in the text
exhibit, the main fact is perfectly plain, and admits
of no doubt whatever, viz. that Hero had brought
the ἄνθραξ on himself by carnal intercourse with
an actress, and the moral reflections Palladius tags
on to it cannot invalidate the fact. The objections
<i>Astruc</i> raises against the conclusiveness of the passage
have already been refuted by <i>Hensler</i> (Geschichte
der Lustseuche,—History of Venereal Disease, I.
pp. 317 sqq.), who while citing as parallel instances
the passages adduced by <i>Becket</i> from the early
XVth Century, very justly remarks: “What proof
<i>would</i> they have, if this is not conclusive?”</p>

<p>Did the female genitals perhaps receive the names
ἐσχάρα (scab) and ἄνθραξ (malignant pustule),
<i>because</i> they very often made men a present of
these things?!</p>

<p>In any case it is an interesting fact that to this
day in India <i>anthrax</i> and chancrous ulcers are
looked upon as akin, and both according to <i>Sir
William Jones</i> (Asiatic Researches Vol. II.) are known
by the name Nar Farsi or Ateshi Farsi (<i>Ignis
Persicus</i>—Persian Fire) to the Cabirajas or Indian
physicians. Now if we think of the great care taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
by the Jews to ensure the multiplication of their
race, the readiness with which various forms of
ulceration pass over into mortification in hot localities,—as
is shown by the examples of Apion and
Hero,—and consequently the serious liability of the
organs of generation to be destroyed, it will occasion
less surprise when we read among the laws of
<i>Moses</i><a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> the following injunction: “And if a man
shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall
uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her
fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her
blood; and both of them shall be cut off from
among their people.” Surely great and serious
resulting injuries must in no inconsiderable number
of instances have been before his eyes for a Lawgiver
to feel himself constrained to assign the death penalty
to the act of coition with women during menstruation,—and
this in spite of the fact that he had
already in a general way declared the woman at
this time, as well as everything she touched, to be
unclean. Again on the other hand coition with
women in this condition must with the Jews have
been amongst things practised with more than ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
frequency, if only such an extreme punishment availed
to check it; and so we cannot really be surprised
to find that the Holy Books of that Nation perhaps
earlier than the writings of any other People were
acquainted only too well with diseases of the genital
organs acquired by coition. The particular disease
that broke out in consequence of the worship of
Baal-Peor has been discussed above in §§ 8 and 9;
while the fact that the Mosaic books contain the
first traces of a knowledge of <i>Gonorrhoea</i> has long
been regarded as proved beyond a doubt<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>If the Climate already exerted such an influence
on the aboriginal inhabitants, how much greater must
this have been where foreigners were concerned, on
whom all endemic excitants of disease in a country
notoriously work with augmented virulence. In
Antiquity this fact must have been even more
conspicuously true, inasmuch as at that period the
Nations still remained much more unmixed than
they subsequently became. It is a thing which
always hitherto, speaking generally, has been far too
little taken account of by Pathologists, but which is
surely of vast importance in connection with the rise
and spread of Venereal disease,—without its being
in any way implied that we must necessarily therefore
adopt the theory of its American origin<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
we are not much mistaken, this factor was operative
also in the case of the Plague of Baal-Peor. Now
what holds good for the Jews, must equally hold
good for the other peoples of Asia and of Egypt,
and even in an enhanced degree, since these, as
we have seen above, gave way to vicious indulgence
to a yet more excessive degree.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, then as now distinctions no doubt
existed, and probably in Antiquity as at the present
day there were districts, whose physical conditions
of climate might be regarded as actually forming a
counteracting factor, and where in spite of excesses
the genital organs seldom became diseased. The
evidence for this must be given by later investigations,
for we must of necessity first possess a geographical
Nosology of Venereal disease at the present day, if
we are ever to succeed in finding and utilizing the
materials for the same in Antiquity. What has been
so far collected by the meritorious <i>Schnurrer</i> in his
Geographical Nosology is too incomplete to justify
us at present in drawing any certain conclusions,
more particularly as the greatest part of the material
contributed by him is drawn from the communications
of non-medical enquirers.</p>

<p>The climate of <i>Greece</i> neither exercised any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>pre-eminently
stimulating effect on the sexual activity
of the genitals, nor yet did it afford a ground for
the enhancement of their individual activity. Thus
enjoying as it did in consequence of that happy
combination of its seasons justly celebrated by ancient
Writers<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> the advantages, without the disadvantages,
of the Tropics, and its inhabitants possessing all
functions in a more vigorous proportion, the climate
could not possibly have been directly favourable to
the rise of affections of the genitals; and for this
reason made unnecessary all precautionary measures
aimed at them, such as were required in Asia. <i>Italy</i>
exhibits but little analogy with the Greek climate;
still it cannot certainly without considerable qualification
be reckoned among factors favourable to maladies
of the genital organs. From this we may at any
rate partly explain why the physicians of Greece
and Rome give so little satisfactory information on
the diseases in question, though indeed, as we shall
see presently, in this case other and quite distinct
factors were at work.</p>


<h4>§ 30.</h4>

<p>We have now seen that Climate is <i>ipso facto</i> an
important factor favourable to the rise of affections
of the genital organs. How much <i>more</i> powerful an
influence must it exert on such affections when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
already in existence. Thus the question, <i>what
influence did Climate manifest in Antiquity on the
character and course of affections of the genitals</i>, is one
of the utmost moment in connection with a History
of Venereal disease,—the more so as on a correct
answer being given to it depends the correctness of
our views as to the form taken in such cases by the
morbid process in Ancient times. True such a
question presupposes the existence of these affections,
and ought therefore, strictly speaking, only to be
raised after the conclusion of our present investigations.
However we think enough evidence has already been
adduced in the preceding pages to remove all possible
doubt from the mind of an attentive reader as to
such being the case. Besides, this appears to us the
more convenient course,—to survey in its entirety
the influence exerted by Climate, rather than to take
up our investigation of the subject afresh in different
places, and thus to a greater or less extent mangle
the discussion of it.</p>

<p>Preponderance of the vegetative principle combined
with a certain slackness of tissue is the character of
all organisms coming under the influence of the
climate of Southern lands. In these countries an
extra-ordinary stimulus acts on the mucous membrane
of the genitals, and the character described will find
its expression here also. Reaction will proceed not
so much from the arterial side, or show itself under
the guise of sthenic inflammation, but rather take
the form merely of intensified secretion. What this
increased secretion aims at is the removal of the
abnormal stimulus, and the flow of mucus so originating
manifests itself as simple, so to speak merely
catarrhal, blennorrhoea. This, where the atmosphere
is not impregnated with moist vapours, readily disappears,
if only somewhat greater care is bestowed
on the maintenance of cleanliness,—and all the more
so, as re-absorption, which in hot climates acts
vigorously on all the mucous membranes generally,
very soon gets the upper hand again in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
that of the genital organs, seconded as it is by the
activity of the external skin. The latter is always
in a condition of enhanced action at the same time,
while the extent of its surface of course markedly
exceeds that of the mucous membrane of the genitals.
On the other hand where the atmosphere is especially
moist, the activity of the skin, as well as the process
of re-absorption internally, appears to be less; and
so under these circumstances the mucous flow will
assume more of a chronic character, but at the same
time to an even greater degree be free from inflammatory
reaction.</p>

<p>All the more recent observations agree in one
thing, viz. that in Southern countries the gonorrhoeal
forms predominate, and speaking generally, almost
always run a mild course that hardly calls for medical
interference. There is no doubt Climatic conditions
in Antiquity differed but little from those of to-day;
so that we may safely assume that equally in Ancient
times blennorrhoea showed the same general characteristics,
a fact which existing traditions moreover
prove beyond question. The frequency of blennorrhoea
of the genital organs in Antiquity is shown at
once by the just quoted passage from the Mosaic
Books, while its mildness of character may be gathered
amongst other things from the remedies employed
by the old Physicians, who almost without exception
followed the principle laid down by <i>Celsus</i> (VI. 18.),
to treat gonorrhoea <i>levibus medicamentis</i> (with gentle
remedial measures), if they were called upon to apply
treatment at all. At least this is true of acute
blennorrhoea; the chronic form of the complaint,
with which alone as a general rule they had to do,
of course required astringents. No doubt each failure
of arterial reaction afforded yet another reason for
the belief on the part of the Ancients that gonorrhoea
was a result of weakness of the seed-secreting vessels,
and their idea that the discharge was merely badly
prepared semen. Supposing, as must have happened,
that marks of increased activity appeared, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
proceeded not so much from the circulatory system
at all as from the nerves, and <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> was correct
in referring Priapism under these conditions to
spasmodic convulsion.</p>

<p>So much for mucous discharge. It was the same
also with the various forms of ulceration of the
genitals. The conditions to be enumerated presently
in the next Section were already present to counteract
their rise in any considerable proportion. Further,
if they did appear in the high lands of Asia and in
Upper Egypt more frequently than did blennorhoea,—this
much is shown plainly at any rate by present-day
experience,—still they lasted but a short time, as the
preponderant activity of vegetative growth, seconded
by extraneous assistance, soon mastered the disease,
and quickly restored again the loss of tissue. The
course of events was otherwise indeed on lower
levels, as in Syria and Lower Egypt, districts which
besides their high temperature also showed a considerable
degree of moisture in the atmosphere and
soil. Here accordingly the different forms of ulceration,
unless careful precautions were taken, assumed
a malignant character, and readily passed over into
gangrene (ἄνθραξ), as we saw a little above happened
in the cases of Apion and Hero. By this means it
is true every specific characteristic of the morbid
alteration was annihilated; <i>but</i> this only made the
risk to the individual so much the greater, the patient
being at best only too apt to lose the organ attacked</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>Again, though sometimes the part escaped destruction
by gangrene, even then its cure was often
difficult owing to the fact that, where the malady
had been neglected, worms made their appearance
in the ulcers<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>, and set up so profuse and so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
spreading a suppuration that the patient eventually
succumbed to it. Of this we have an example in
the Emperor Galerius Maximianus, mentioned by
<i>Eusebius</i><a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>, and to which allusion is made as early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
as in the Book of Ecclesiasticus (XIX. 2, 3.), when
the Author, Jesus the son of Sirach, says: “Wine
and women will make men of understanding to fall
away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become
impudent. <i>Moths</i> (<i>otherwise<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>—Rottenness and worms</i>)
shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall
be taken away.” The use of knife and actual
cautery must naturally have played an important
part under these circumstances in the treatment
adopted; but these the patient often dreaded more
than the malady itself, and chose suicide rather
than submit to them, like the “Municeps” whose
story Pliny tells in the passage quoted in a previous
chapter. But now supposing suchlike ulcers to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
situated in the mouth of a <i>fellator</i> or <i>cunnilingue</i>,
then their course must have been all the more
rapid, and the danger involved all the greater, if
the patient lived in such a climate as described;
and it was in this way the Αἰγύπτια καὶ Συριακὰ
and Βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα (Egyptian and Syrian sores,
Bubastic sores) mentioned above acquired their evil
repute. Still in the majority of cases these climatic
influences could be counteracted by appropriate
medical aid and dietetic measures, or at any rate
their effect considerably reduced. Hence it was
that cases of the sort only very rarely appeared
in Antiquity, and for this very reason were noted
by the Historians, when they did occur.</p>

<p>The human organism possessed in Southern lands
yet another way of combating the enemy’s attacks,
one which would seem to have escaped the notice
of the Physicians of Antiquity, and which, though
recognized in modern times, has yet never been at
all adequately appreciated and utilized in the history
of Venereal disease, viz. <i>the reaction exhibited by the
skin in diseases of the genital organs in hot climates</i>.
So long as authorities thought of the external skin
as merely compacted of separate and distinct layers
of tissue, there could not really be any question of
an accurate knowledge of its functions whether
under healthy or under morbid conditions. The
investigations of <i>Breschet</i> and <i>Roussel de Vauzène</i><a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
as confirmed and reinforced by <i>Gurlt</i><a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>, have now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
taught us to understand that the skin, over and
above these layers, possesses as a matter of fact,—a
fact formerly only conjectured,—special organs
belonging to the same class as the glands, to wit the
skin, hair and sweat glands. These share amongst
them the function hitherto ascribed to the skin
generally, and especially bring into correlation the
sympathies of the different parts, so much so that
they may be said to be almost the sole and only
seat of the manifold forms of skin-diseases. All
this we endeavoured first to demonstrate in the series
of Articles on Skin-diseases in “<i>Blasius’</i> Handwörterbuch
der Chirurgie und Augenheilkunde” (Manual
of Surgery and Ophthalmology), and so pave the
way for a compendious Survey of our knowledge of
the Skin-diseases up to the present time.</p>

<p>Now while the sweat-glands stand in a special
connection of sympathy and antagonism with the
lungs, the same correlation exists in a peculiar degree
between the glands of the mucous membrane of the
intestinal canal and of the genital organs on the
one hand and the cutaneous glands on the other
which secrete the <i>sebum</i> or sebaceous humour. It
would take us too far a-field, if we undertook in
this place to enter upon a detailed explanation of
this circumstance, which however is still in sore need
of further clearing up. We shall content ourselves
with recalling the fact that Onanists (Masturbators)
not only often betray themselves by having a nose
with a shiny, tallowy looking surface that comes from
excessive secretion of <i>sebum</i>, but also not less
frequently by their face being covered with <i>acne</i>
pustulus. One more fact we must mention is that
the outbreak of <i>acne</i> very often with girls heralds
the approach of each period of menstruation, and
accompanies it<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>. These are signs clearly pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
to the conclusion that stimulations of the genitals
are reflected back on the glands of the skin, for
<i>acne</i> is nothing else but an affection of these glands,
as we have demonstrated in the Work just mentioned.</p>

<p>But indeed there are proofs of this antagonism
still nearer to hand. How frequently have our
physicians observed an eruption<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> resembling <i>roseola</i>
or <i>urticaria</i> in character, at the—very often sudden—appearance
of which the gonorrhoeal symptoms have
much decreased in severity or disappeared altogether!
These skin affections have been ascribed to the
balsam of Copaiva or the Cubebs pepper administered
in these cases, which are supposed to have stimulated
the intestinal mucous membrane and so sympathetically
excited the skin. This may very possibly sometimes
be the case; but it could not but occur much
more frequently, if the remedial agents mentioned
are to bear the sole and entire blame. No doubt
in some patients a particular idiosyncrasy may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
given rise to sympathetic action stimulative of the
intestinal canal, but in the majority the reaction of
the mucous membrane of the genitals on the cutaneous
glands has undoubtedly been a chief contributory
factor under epidemic influences, while the drugs
exhibited have played only a subordinate part in
producing the result. There are cases where the
gonorrhœa has been treated simply and solely by
mere antiphlogistic methods, and yet such an eruption
has been observed.</p>

<p>But it is not in gonorrhœa only that these
phænomena appear; they have been noted as well
in chancre, being then ascribed to the sublimate of
mercury and looked upon as affording a criterion
that the drug had exercised its full effect on the
original complaint. In most cases this was without
doubt a mistake, for Biett, Rayer and other authorities
have noted the most widely divergent forms of skin-disease
to appear concurrently with the existence of
chancre, and in consequence have come to regard
them as primitive symptoms. In fact cases have
actually been observed, where these were the sole
primary symptoms of contagion after indulgence in
unclean coition. At the same time it is only fair
to say that this has been doubted in many quarters,
observers trying to explain the fact of the absence
of other symptoms by saying the ulcers, which are
frequently very minute, may have been overlooked.
At least experience has sufficiently taught us this
much, that the so-called secondary symptoms, and
therefore the skin-affections as well, appear the more
readily in proportion as the ulcers of the genitals
are smaller and more superficial; and we ourselves
believe that never without local reaction on the
genital organs from coition do so-called secondary
appearances arise,—only it is not invariably ulcers
that are to looked for.</p>

<p>Now when even in our temperate climate the
cutaneous glands play a not unimportant part in the
morbid processes of Venereal disease, how much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
more must this be the case in Asia and Egypt,
where the activity of the skin generally and that of
the cutaneous glands in particular is even under
normal conditions far more conspicuously energetic,
as may be seen from the constant oily state of the
skin, more particularly in Negroes. This oily grease
on the skin is in fact nothing more nor less than
the product of the action of the cutaneous glands.
These glands are peculiarly apt to become morbidly
affected in travellers visiting the South during their
acclimatisation; though natives too are yearly attacked
in the Summer months by complaints of the skin-glands.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
The fact has long been recognized<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
in Southern countries not only the greater number
of skin-diseases, but even Venereal disease itself
in an especial degree, appear as an exanthema of
the skin, and for this reason it there displays far
less destructive effects; but as a rule enquirers have
contented themselves with the general habit, without
(as pointed out before) adequately turning the fact
to advantage in connection with the History and
Theory of Venereal disease.</p>

<p>This preponderating bias towards the external skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
must obviously manifest itself equally in other diseases
of the mucous membranes, and so too in those of
the genital organs. Reabsorption in particular, acting
with increased vigour on the mucous surfaces, will
prove its beneficial presence also in the diseases
affecting them. The foreign matter that comes in
contact with these surfaces is assimilated to a less
degree by the mucous glands and by those of the
<i>glans penis</i>, and no time is allowed it to exert a
destructive influence on the small surface receiving
it; on the other hand it is quickly thrown back on
the much more extensive surface of the external
skin, and there dealt with by the cutaneous glands
with their powerful secretive and assimilatory action,
being either assimilated or expelled externally.</p>

<p>In particular localities this quickly happens without
any striking symptoms being locally perceptible in
the skin, as e.g. in Numidia, Libya<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> and the
Northern part of Peru<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>, where the disease is said
to cure itself without extraneous medical aid, and
among the inhabitants generally to be practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
non-existent(?). Though this is not the case in other
countries, still the cutaneous glands become involved
in the morbid process of the disease, and secrete
with augmented copiousness, and the secretion being
simultaneously altered in character, it fails to be
driven out externally, inasmuch as external elimination
is at once stopped owing to the fact that the
cutaneous glands, like the uterus in pregnancy, close
their orifice, so as to be enabled to carry out their
function in their recesses. For this reason the glands
swell, and manifest themselves in the form of <i>papillae</i>
or tubercles (very often as little bladders, or blebs),
changing later either into pustules, if the morbid
products are eventually expelled<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>, or else gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
disappear, if the process of assimilation and re-absorption
has been sufficiently vigorous. Supposing damp,
cold or other unfavourable influences to be at work,
suppuration may very well supervene, or degenerative
processes commence, and so on, and <i>the disease pass
over into leprosy and elephantiasis</i>. This is above all
the case in Egypt, where from the first, chancres on
the genitals would seem to possess a marked tendency
towards scurfy and scabby formations<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>.</p>

<p>If these are the facts at the present day,—and
no one doubts they are,—there only remains the
question: were they so in Ancient times as well?
Here we come face to face with the difficult problem
as to the relation of leprosy with Venereal disease,—a
problem which for Centuries has been the subject
of dispute, and in spite of the very careful enquiries
of a Hensler and of other investigators, cannot by
any means be regarded as solved. Our own investigations
on the Leprosy of the Ancients are as yet
too incomplete, and the nature of the subject demands
such far-reaching inquisition into the most widely
different individual phænomena, that we are
compelled, in order to economise our space, to
renounce all idea of submitting the subject to any
more detailed examination in the present Work.
Besides, in our Second Part we shall be coming
back to it again, when we have under investigation the
question as to whether or no the Venereal disease
of the XVth Century was developed from leprosy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>For our present purpose the following statement
must suffice: The Climate of Asia and Egypt was
in Antiquity, as mentioned already, undoubtedly but
little different from what it is to-day, and the
influence it exerted therefore must have shared in
this resemblance<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>.</p>

<p>As to <i>mentagra</i>, we have already proved a little
above that it was a consequence of the vice of the
<i>cunnilingue</i>, and as according to Pliny’s report the
latter claimed Egypt for its fatherland, obviously
the climate of that country must have been in part
responsible for its origination. Now affections of the
genital organs being found in Antiquity as the result
of sexual intercourse, it follows that in this direction
also Climate must have exerted its influence, and
that in the very same way as we have just above
seen it do,—in other words manifold affections of
the skin must have originated in consequence of
irritation and other morbid effects on the genital
organs. True the Ancient physicians say not a word
of this; but then they derive the greater proportion
of the skin-diseases, which they mass all together in
the most admired confusion, from internal mischief
of various sorts, and regard them all as <i>apostases</i>
(suppurative inflammations carrying off the effect of
fevers, etc.),—at any rate a proof they were not entirely
unacquainted with the antagonistic relations existing
between the skin and other organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>So far as the genitals are concerned, they seem
to have adequately realized only the <i>consensus</i> between
the uterus and the skin<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>, whereas in male subjects
they appear to have put down most of the effects
observed to the liver. But on these points we shall have
something further to say later on. Still the assertion
to the effect that Eunuchs are not attacked by <i>calvities</i>
(baldness) (<i>Hippocrates</i>, I. 400; <i>Galen</i>, XVIII. A. 40.,
also p. 42., where mention is made of the excesses <i>in
Baccho et Venere</i>—in Wine and Love—peculiarly prevalent
at his epoch), which was a frequent consequence of
vice in Antiquity<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>, points to the <i>consensus</i> between
genitals and skin having been already noted. Even
more is the fact, vouched for by <i>Archigenes</i><a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
castration was recommended by some Physicians as
a cure for elephantiasis, such as to arouse the
suspicion that the physicians of Antiquity knew
perfectly well what influence affections of the genital
organs exerted on diseases of the skin. This is made
all the more likely by Archigenes (ch. 120.) not only
speaking of the disease as being contagious, but also
describing the skin-affection as secondary in character.
He further declares its cause to be unknown, puts
on record the extreme lubricity of the patients
(Satyriasis pp. 74, 133, 269.), and even says in so
many words that such as were castrated did not
contract elephantiasis!</p>

<p>We have seen how <i>mentagra</i> attacked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
<i>cunnilingue</i>, and afterwards passed over into <i>psora</i>; in
just the same way might elephantiasis,—a complaint
indeed which the Gloss of the Pseudo-Galen actually
puts in connection with the Morbus Phoeniceus
(Phoenician Disease),—be brought on by indulgence
in coition. This is in no way contradicted by the
preference the disease exhibits for first making its
appearance in the face, inasmuch as the cutaneous
glands of the face are in a relation of special sympathy
with the genital organs. That leprosy too no less
than elephantiasis was communicated and contracted
by coition is shown by a host of examples given in
the Mediæval Historians<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>; in fact, a large number
of Physicians held Venereal disease to be a species
of leprosy or elephantiasis, while some made it
actually originate in the act of coition with leprous
persons; yet for all that we do not, according to
<i>Hensler</i>, (“Vom Aussatz”,—On Leprosy, p. 396.),
find it anywhere recorded that the genital organs
were first affected,—apart that is from what <i>Astruc</i>
has brought forward on purpose to support his own
view. As everybody knows, <i>he</i> refers all local evils
existing prior to the end of the XVth Century to
Leprosy.</p>

<p>But what would follow supposing traces <i>were</i>
actually to be found proving that what was known
in Asia as leprosy did as a matter of fact first show
itself in the genitals? Before we enter upon the
closer examination of reasons for this supposition,
we must quote a passage from the Work of <i>Von
Roeser</i> already several times mentioned, a passage
equally important for the pathology of Venereal
disease as for its History. <i>Von Roeser</i>, (p. 68.) writes
thus: “Primary syphilis manifests itself <i>in Egypt in
the very rarest cases on the prepuce or glans of the
verge</i>; the chancres are more commonly found on
the outer skin of the penis nearer the <i>mons Veneris</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
or actually on this in the hairy parts which among
Egyptians and Arabs are generally kept shaved, <i>or
else on the scrotum</i>. <i>Pruner</i><a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> told me that the occurrence
of a chancre on the prepuce, which indeed is
absent in Mohammedans owing to circumcision, or
on the <i>glans penis</i> is in the ratio of 1: 3 to chancres
on the last mentioned parts, hence in that country
Astruc’s opinion that syphilitic ulcers hardly ever
formed on the exterior of the verge, is strongly
contradicted,—as is no less true amongst ourselves.
That circumcision is not the sole cause of this
phænomenon is manifest from the fact that in Smyrna
and Constantinople I saw plenty of chancres on the
<i>glans</i>, as well as amongst Jews at home, though I am
not going to deny that circumcision may have some
share in causing the rarity of the appearance of a
chancre on the <i>glans</i>,—but this does not in any way
explain the frequency of their appearance on the
scrotum and the <i>mons Veneris</i>. A tendency to take
the exanthematic type, a tendency which makes
itself known also by the fact of <i>many chancres</i>
commonly appearing at once and <i>showing in a
marked degree a preference for scurfy and scabby forms</i>,
might very possibly afford a better explanation of
the phænomenon in question.”</p>

<p>Now as to the supposition just expressed, this is
based on a repeated examination of a passage
of the very utmost importance in the history of
leprosy, viz. Ch. XIII. of Leviticus—a chapter
which has exercised Theologians no less than
Physicians for Centuries, but without our being
enabled to regard the investigations it has given rise
to as in any way concluded. However it is no
intention of ours to provide in this place a commentary
on this Chapter, more particularly as we
do not possess the philological acquirements necessary
for a critical appreciation of the results so far obtained.
Neither, speaking in general terms, has anything like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
sufficient progress in the study of original sources
for the history of leprosy as yet been made to enable
an adequate judgement to be formed; we much
prefer to limit our efforts at present to contributing
sundry observations, which stand in close connection
with our immediate object, and at the same time
may afford readers, whether scientific or philological
authorities, an opportunity of favouring us with their
judgement as specialists.</p>

<p>The correct understanding of the whole passage
appears to us to depend in the first place on the
success of the endeavour to find a certain and definite
explanation of the expression בְּעוֹר בְּשָׂרוֹ  (b’ôr b’sarô,—“skin
of the flesh” in English Authorized Version).
Luther rendered this by: <i>on the skin of his flesh</i>;
the Septuagint translators give it as ἐν δέρματι
χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ (in the skin of the surface); while
<i>de Wette</i> (whose Translation of the passage generally
we hereby ask the reader to consult, space not
allowing us to quote the whole Chapter) translates
it <i>on the skin of his body</i>, and understands by the
expression every part of the external skin.</p>

<p>Supposing this translation the correct one, it will
be a hard matter to explain how it was the hair
should simultaneously have turned <i>white</i>, a circumstance
which strangely enough caused even Hensler
no surprise. Rosenmüller in his Scholia on the
passage says: <i>Schilling</i> (<i>De lepra p. 7.</i>) <i>observat, in
lepra alba pilos albescere</i>, (<i>Schilling</i>, On Leprosy p. 7.
notes that in white leprosy the hair grows white);
but it is only the <i>partes pilosae aut capillatae</i> (hairy
parts, parts covered with long hair) that are here
intended, and these are to be understood as including
merely the head, eye-brows, chin, armpits and pubic
region. Obviously the hair on other parts of the
body cannot be taken here into consideration, as it
is specifically almost colourless, and though it is true
it may have had a stronger coloration in many Jews,
surely they did not <i>all</i> belong to the race of Esau.
Again all writers on leprosy, when this mischief affecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the hair is in question, speak solely of the hair of
the parts named<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>. So when <i>Haly Abbas</i> in a passage
quoted by Hensler (<i>Excerpta</i> p. 9.), in which he is
treating of <i>Allopitia</i> and <i>Tyria</i> (forms of leprosy),
says, <i>Nonnunquam totius accidit pilis corporis</i> (Sometimes
this happens to all the hair of the body), this
also is to be understood merely of the parts above
named. Indeed <i>Hensler</i> himself (Vom Aussatz,—On
Leprosy, p. 304.) assumes this when, after speaking
of the hair of the head and beard, he goes on:
“But this mischief may also attack other hairy parts
of the body. <i>Haly Abbas</i> says, (<i>Excerpta</i> p. 9.) At
times this affects also the hair of the whole body.
True the passage of <i>Hippocrates</i>, in view of the
erroneous punctuation, seems to belong more properly
to what follows, still even by itself it would be
probable enough, as <i>the preliminary symptoms are
found particularly in the arm-pit and the groin</i>, and
might of course extend their ravages there, just as
much as on the head.” However should anyone
wish to understand here <i>all</i> the hairy parts of the
body mentioned, and suppose the Author to be
speaking in the first instance in a general sense, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
what follows will not agree, for the hair of the head
and beard was <i>not</i> changed into <i>white</i>, but into
<i>yellow</i> ( צָהֹב ), as V. 30 states. There are left therefore
only the eye-brows, arm-pits and the pubic region,
to which the transformation to white can apply.</p>

<p>Granting these considerations to be correct, it is
impossible to understand the <i>b’ôr b’sarô</i> as signifying
the whole exterior surface of the skin; it must imply
a local limitation. But the limited area intended
can be nothing but <i>the genitals</i>, and this agrees best
at once with the facts and with the usages of Biblical
phraseology. In more than one passage, in fact,
of the Old Testament <i>basar</i>, like σάρξ (flesh) in the
New, has the meaning of “sexual parts”; and even
in English the word <i>flesh</i>, particularly in ecclesiastical
language, is consecrated by custom in this sense.
So Luther was perfectly justified in the passage
under discussion in translating as he did: <i>on the
skin of his flesh</i>, that is to say, of his genitals. The
particular combination of <i>b’ôr b’sarô</i> we have not it
is true been able to find used generally in the books
of the Old Testament, but we must not therefore
conclude absolutely that it is unique and peculiar
to this XIIIth. Chapter; though indeed, if such <i>were</i>
the case, it would merely be an additional confirmation
of the explanation we have given.</p>

<p>So far as the matter of fact goes, such an assumption
offers no difficulties,—indeed it actually removes
several, as e.g. that connected with the coloration
of the skin, and not only proves that already at that
date pustules on the genitals had been observed that
were free from any suspicion of malignant character,
but further that along with a suspicious pustule or
similar symptom (scurf, ulcer) there went a simultaneous
general affection of the skin as a whole,
which was held to be diagnostic for the local malady,
and accordingly proclaimed even the suspected leper
free from taint after his recovery from it. For
evidently we must take verses 12 and 13 as indicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
this, where it is stated in so many words: “And
if the leprosy break out ( פָּרַח, —blossom) abroad in
the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him
that hath the plague from his head even to his feet,
as far as appeareth to the priest; then the priest
shall look: and behold, if the leprosy have covered
all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath
the plague; it is all turned white: he is clean.”
(English Revised Version). The last words have
been wrongly referred by some Interpreters to the
“Bohak” (bright spot), which is mentioned in verse
39., but really nothing more than this is intended:—after
the eruption is dried up, and the skin has
returned to its natural white colour, then the hitherto
sick man is to be declared clean<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>.</p>

<p>This diagnostic eruption again points to another
fact, viz. that the leprosy must have had its seat in
a part of the body, the cutaneous glands of which
stand in a relation of lively sympathy with those of
the skin generally, and this according to modern
experience can only be the cutaneous glands of the
genital organs. Sometimes inoculation with cow-pox
lymph brings out a general eruption of the whole
skin, but this circumstance cannot well be made
pertinent here, as really and truly the lymph is a
resultant product of a feverish affection, and therefore
its innate tendency is towards a reproduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
itself under circumstances of feverish stimulation, and
to set the whole organism, and consequently the
whole cutaneous glandular system, in a state of
enhanced activity. How the diagnostic eruption
comes about may be gathered from the statement
of the case given just above; while the passage
quoted from <i>von Roeser’s</i> Work will explain the rest.
Still for the present this much may suffice to put
the expert reader in a position to test our conjecture,—for
indeed so far it makes no profession to be more
than a conjecture. Supposing it found tenable, then
the further consequences that cannot but grow from
it for the elucidation of the Chapter in discussion
may be readily developed. On the other hand, if
it is devoid of justification, it would be quite useless
further to elaborate a hypothesis, plunging a subject
obscure enough without this in even deeper darkness.
Further than this we only need to mention
that <i>Hensler</i> and others hold <i>mentagra</i> to be indicated
in the bald chin and scurfy (scall) chin of Leviticus
(XIII. 29 sqq.), which if they are right would merely
be another point in favour of our view.</p>

<p>Finally there can hardly be any need for us to
observe that we have no idea of holding leprosy in
general to be a consequence of excesses; on the
contrary we believe, to return to the problem we
started with at the beginning of this Section, that
we are bound to agree to the opinion first explicitly
laid down by <i>Becket</i><a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>, viz. <i>that under the widely
comprehensive notion of Leprosy were included other
forms of skin-diseases owing their existence to some
previous affection of the genital organs</i>,—in precisely
the same way as this happened in the Middle Ages,
and as may be the case occasionally even at the
present day.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>


<h3 id="S_31">§ 31.</h3>


<p>What precise influence Climate exerted on the
form taken and course run by affections of the
genital organs <i>in Greece and Italy</i>, can be only
approximately laid down, as the information supplied
by Physicians, though ample in quantity, mostly
leaves the point indefinite as to where the observations
were made, whether in Asia Minor and Egypt
(Alexandria), or in Greece and Italy. The last
named country indeed was, as is well known,
almost entirely devoid of independent native medical
Writers.</p>

<p>The mild, genial sky of Greece and Italy impressed
on all forms of disease, including diseases of the
genitals, a mild character. There, on the confines
of East and West, we find, it is true, the same natural
tendencies prevailing as in Asia, but always on a
less exaggerated scale. <i>Von Roeser</i> (loco citato p. 70.)
says: “In conclusion we should note further that in
Egypt gonorrhœa is a complaint of very rare
occurrence, in Greece and Turkey a very common
one. That the exanthematic character taken by
syphilis is not(?) responsible for the fact of its not
manifesting itself as gonorrhœa is confirmed by the
circumstance that it occurs much more frequently in
Greece than amongst ourselves, whereas syphilis in
that country has (though not in an identical form)
the exanthematic type to an even greater degree
than in our own.” <i>D. Hennen</i><a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> found Venereal
disease rare in Cephalonia, but on the contrary
gonorrhœa quite common.</p>

<p>No doubt the tendency to determine towards the
skin is clearly noticeable in Greece as well, but not
to such an extent as to outweigh the local affection.
The latter accordingly takes a more independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
form than is the case in Asia, and for this reason,
though making its appearance more frequently, neither
follows so rapid a course nor shows so destructive
a character,—if only the organism is seconded to
some extent in the efforts to combat the malady.
This is shown by the statements <i>Galen</i> has left as
to gonorrhœa and ulcers occurring in connection
with bubonic swellings,—a matter we shall have
occasion to speak of later. While in Asia the skin
affection is manifested by the formation of pustules
and scurf, in Greece and neighbouring countries of
the South it rather takes the shape of <i>papillae</i> and
small blisters or blebs, and only in obstinate cases
breaks out in tubercles. Hence <i>lepra</i>, <i>psora</i>, <i>lichen</i>,
and <i>elephantiasis</i> are the forms under which we must
look for it in the medical Writers of Antiquity, who
however say nothing as to the origin of these diseases,
or else, as we have seen before, refer them all to
deficiency of the moist humours<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>.</p>

<p>We have never yet succeeded, though we have
before now expended much time on the effort, in
getting a clear grasp of the ideas the Ancient
physicians intended to express by the different designations
they gave to the various skin-diseases. So
we are constrained to postpone deeper investigation
of the question to a subsequent occasion, or wait
to see whether meantime some other enquirer, better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
equipped for the work, may not throw light on the
chaos. Only so far as <i>Scabies</i> (Scab) is concerned,
it would seem allowable to assume allusions to be
intended to vicious living as a cause of the malady.
It cannot be without a reason that for centuries this
one above all other skin diseases seems to have
fallen under special disrepute; and the term to have
been used by poets, by <i>Martial</i><a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> for example, to
indicate that sensual indulgence had been at work.
In fact, several of the earliest Writers on Venereal
disease hold it to be a sort of <i>scabies</i>, and even at
a later period there is for long frequent mention
made of <i>Venereal scars or scabs</i>. Possibly also in
Greece lepra (leprosy) was looked upon as a form
of skin-disease that was come by in no reputable
way, and commonly regarded as an inheritance of
the debauchees<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>, just as we saw to be the case with
<i>mentagra</i> at Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>Affections of the external skin consequent upon
complaints of the genital organs being thus no less
common in Ancient times than they are to-day, it
follows that in inverse proportion forms of ulceration
of the palate and nose, as well as complaints affecting
the bones, must have fallen into the background and
have been of more rare occurrence, just as is observed
to be the case in the present day<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>. So, to combine
all the varying forms under one generalisation, we
may say that this represents a type of disease of an
exceedingly mild and favourable character, particularly
if attention is directed only to the external symptoms,
as indeed was habitually done by the old pathologists.
For even the skin-affection itself presents so little
that is characteristic, or at any rate shows itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
under such varying shapes, that even at the present
day its diagnosis is extremely difficult, being very
often based solely and entirely on the admission of
the patient, whether voluntary or forced from him,
of having suffered from gonorrhœa or chancre. But
if the so-called secondary symptoms are more or
less completely absent, or lack distinctness, what is
there then left beyond the primary affections of the
genitals and their succedanea? Full and sufficient
descriptions of these are not lacking; we have already
quoted numerous examples, and we shall find others
yet clearer and more precise later on.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject of the influence exerted
by Climate, we are bound to return once more to
the question, <i>in what relation did contagion</i>, if
contagion there was, <i>stand to this climatic influence?</i>
The existence of contagion in the case of gonorrhœa
is certified by the passage of <i>Galen</i> already quoted
by Naumann, which we propose later on to give in
full, besides being implied long before by the law
of purification of the Mosaic Books. So far as
ulcerous formations, condylomata and skin-affections
such as <i>mentagra</i> etc., are concerned, proof is supplied
by the facts we have previously given. According
to more modern experience all forms of contagion
exhibit in Southern countries a more fugitive type
than elsewhere and spread with proportionately
greater readiness. Whereas in such as are naturally
fugitive, the intensity may for that very reason be
less injurious, fixed and stable forms of contagion
on the contrary must obviously lose in strength, at
any rate so far as their local effects go. They will
be the less able to make good a lodgement in the
organism, from the fact that, stimulating the latter
as they do to a general activity, they are the more
readily resisted and prevented by this very state of
enhanced activity. For just as, speaking generally,
chronic complaints, uncomplicated by fever, can only
be removed by artificially setting up a feverish
condition, that is to say by calling on the organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
as a whole to share in the local manifestations of
disease. Precisely the same is true of local affections
set up by any fixed and stable contagion, and so
the removal of the actual contagion can only be
successfully brought about either by direct decomposition
and destruction of the affected tissue or by
metamorphosis into a fugitive form.</p>

<p>Now inasmuch as the contagion was rapidly
thrown off from the point of first infection upon the
cutaneous glands,—and this happened the more
readily, the more fugitive its character was,—the
affections there set up by it standing in such clear
relation as they did with the primary symptoms,
were necessarily bound also to exhibit a greater or
less degree of the contagious character, as indeed
is observed according to <i>Jos. Frank</i>, <i>Biett</i> and other
authorities even in Europe to the present day. In
Greece, where the transformation was less often to
pustular and scurfy forms, more frequently merely
to papillae or at worst little bladder-like risings, or
blebs (Phlyctaenae), while at the same time the
energy of the skin was not so pronounced, the
interval between the appearance of the primary and
secondary symptoms was greater, and the contagiousness
of the skin-affections undoubtedly less
prominent, it cost the organism in that climate much
more strenuous effort to set in action the elimination
of the disease by the skin. Consequently the nervous
system as well was injuriously affected by
sympathy to a greater extent, while the exanthematic
forms showed themselves in more obvious
conjunction with itch (<i>psora!</i>). This was partially
the case in Italy too, though here the climate
approximated more nearly to that of Lower Egypt,
leading to a more frequent appearance of pustulous
forms, as shown by the prevalence in that country
of <i>mentagra</i>.</p>

<p>But just as climatic influence relaxed the intensity
of contagion, and diminished concurrently the malignancy
of disease-types, local as well as general, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
on the contrary, in those cases where other influences
tended to counteract its effect, while the organism
was not strong enough to overmaster the assaults
of the enemy by general or local activity, it sought
to guard against the contagion rising to a higher
degree of independence; it set up mortification of
the ulcers, by which means the contagion itself was
directly destroyed. From all this it may be concluded,
that although climate must evidently be
acknowledged to be an important factor favourable
to the rise of affections of the genital organs in
Antiquity as much as at the present day, yet on
the other hand it tended by its own action to
combat the mischief it had originated; and so, at
any rate so far as the development of the morbid
process is concerned, is to be regarded to an almost
equal degree as a counteracting influence at the
same time.</p>


<h4 id="S_32">§ 32.</h4>


<p>The experience of all ages has conclusively proved
that a large proportion of such morbid phæenomena
as occur in consequence of local climatic conditions
are capable equally of being produced sooner or
later in countries and neighbourhoods the climate
of which is entirely different by help of the <i>genius
epidemicus</i>; and that the readiness with which they
are so produced varies in direct ratio with the
degree in which the climate is associated with and
seconds the favourable factors. It is indeed extremely
difficult, in view of the low level of development to
which the science of Epidemics, in general no less
than in particular, has as yet attained, to show this
as applicable in any given case, more especially if
it is a question of the epidemic condition of some
disease of which the pathological relations themselves
are far from being as yet adequately known. Still
this must not prevent us from making at any rate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
an attempt at investigation of the question, how
much or how little effort has been manifested by
such influence in the course of years.</p>

<p>But the influence of the genius epidemicus on
diseases in general is a twofold one. <i>Either</i> it supplies
the capital, most essential external circumstances
conditioning the production of a disease, in fact is
related to it as cause to effect. In virtue of it
the disease is an <i>epidemic</i> disease, coming into
existence for the first time concurrently with the
development of the genius epidemicus, disappearing
again with the cessation of its prevalence, and
once again springing up if and when the genius
epidemicus makes a second re-appearance. <i>Or else</i>
the most essential external conditioning circumstances
are specifically independent of the genius epidemicus;
while the latter takes merely a remote
share in the way of favouring or counteracting the
production of the disease, manifesting its influence
rather in modifying the form and direction of such
morbid reactions as have arisen in the organism
without its intervention at all,—in other words <i>the
disease is subject to epidemic influence</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately hitherto these two kinds of influence
exerted by the genius epidemicus have been only
too often confounded, and no adequate distinction
drawn between epidemic diseases on the one hand
and diseases subject to epidemic influence on the
other. This has been especially so with regard to
Venereal disease, the epidemic character of which
curiously enough enquirers have felt bound to vindicate,
as well at the beginning of the XVth. Century
as here and there even at the present day. The
baselessness of such an opinion is so perfectly
obvious to anyone who weighs the matter with any
care, that we really do not think it necessary to
devote more pains now to proving the point, particularly
as we propose to treat it more fully in
another place. On the other hand Venereal disease
<i>is</i> subject to epidemic influence, in fact it is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
perhaps to a greater extent than many other forms
of sickness, as will be clearly shown in the course
of our historical investigations. Accordingly the
only question still wanting an answer is, how far
such influence may have been effectual in Antiquity.
This question of course presupposes the existence
already of a number of diseases appearing in consequence
of Venereal excesses; still we possess
sufficient proof, as previously stated in the course
of our enquiries into the influence of climate, to
justify a provisional assumption of their existence
for our immediate purpose. For openly admitting
as we do our ignorance in relation to the influence
of the genius epidemicus on sexual activity generally
and on the individual activity of the genital organs
in particular, and noting the problem to be one
that can only be solved in the future, there is
nothing else left us to investigate here but this, viz.
<i>the influence of the genius epidemicus in reference to the
forms taken and course followed by diseases occurring
in consequence of Venereal excesses</i>.</p>

<p>It may be collected from later experience and
observation that there are three clearly marked forms
of the genius epidemicus or <i>epidemic condition</i>, that
exercise a preponderating influence on affections of
the genitals and Venereal disease, and condition
the frequency of the occurrence of one or the other
type of these, viz. <i>catarrhal</i>, conditioning blennorrhœal
affections, the <i>exanthematic</i>, conditioning
complaints of the cutaneous glands, and the <i>typhoïdal</i>,
conditioning various forms of chancre and their
malignancy.</p>

<p>With regard to the influence of the <i>genius epidemicus
catarrhalis</i> and <i>exanthematicus</i>, it would seem to be
difficult to arrive at any definite conclusion as to
what precisely this was in Asia and the South of
Europe, since the Climate was <i>ipso facto</i>, as already
shown, pre-eminently favourable to blennorrhœal
and cutaneous affections; nevertheless the rise and
spread of mentagra as well as of elephantiasis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
in the time of Pompey the Great does afford some
indication at any rate so far as Italy is concerned.
No doubt the Hippocratic writers several
times mention the prevalence of skin affections at
particular periods; but the expressions they employ
are too general to make it possible for us to take
these into special consideration in this place. However
there is one passage we must make an exception
of,—a passage of the greatest importance for our
purpose, even though in all probability it refers to
the commencement of a combined erysipelas-typhoïdal
condition, to which we shall have occasion to return
again later. In it Hippocrates relates how after a
dry Summer with Southerly winds and frequent rain
there followed a mild, wet Winter, next cold and
even snow-storms succeeded in the Spring with much
rain, and finally a very hot Summer again. In the
Spring began inflammatory fevers and erysipelas,
and<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> “in many cases aphthae and ulcerations formed
in the mouth, many rheums occurred in the genitals
taking the form of ulcers and abscesses on the
external and internal surface of the sexual parts;
also eye troubles, with discharge, obstinate, persistent
and painful; also growths, which are called σῦκα
(figs) on the inner and outer surface of the eye-lids,
causing many to lose their sight; besides they frequently
occurred on other parts liable to ulceration
and particularly on the genital organs.” In this
passage the expressions ἑλκώματα, φύματα, ἔξωθεν
ἔσωθεν τὰ περὶ βουβῶνας (ulcers and abscesses on
the external and internal surface of the sexual parts)
is as a rule misunderstood by the annotators. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
really ἔξωθεν (on the outside) evidently refers to
ἑλκώματα (ulcers), while ἔσωθεν (on the inside)
goes with φύματα (abscesses), and signifies a swelling
and inflammation of a mucous gland resulting in
suppuration, as may be seen from the next quoted
Aphorism<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>. “Such patients as have φύματα
(abscesses) in the urethra find relief, so soon as these
have suppurated and broken.” That this relief
(λύσις) consisted in the cessation of pain and of the
retention of urine may be gathered not only from
Galen’s commentary on the first passage, and from
the λύεται ὁ πόνος (the suffering is relieved) in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
repetition of the same Aphorism, but Hippocrates
actually says so distinctly in a third passage<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>.</p>

<p>Supposing the view, still generally held even in
the last Century, that regards gonorrhœa as a result
of an ulcer in the urethra, to have been already
adopted in Hippocrates’time,—and inasmuch as the
expression γονοῤῥοία, so far as we know, never
occurs in his writings, the assumption would not only
not be absurd, but such a view would really be
preferable to that which makes out the discharge to
be badly made semen,—we shall find in this passage
an expression of the fact of the more common
occurrence of gonorrhœa, the most troublesome
symptom of which, viz. the pain suffered during
micturition (πόνος, δυσουρία, ἰσχουρία, suffering,
difficulty in micturition, retention of urine), disappears,
as is well known, concurrently with the commencement
of the discharge (πύου ῥαγέντος, φυμάτων
ῥαγέντων,—when the pus has broken out, when the
abscess has broken), or if it does not entirely disappear,
is at any rate sensibly diminished. But it is
not really needful to accept this as having been the
ruling opinion; the facts may very well be accounted
for by supposing that in virtue of the <i>epidemic
condition</i> a strongly marked tendency was set up on
the part of the glandular organs to inflammatory and
suppurative action, by which not merely the glands
of the external skin (ἑλκώματα ἔξωθεν),—ulcerations
on the outside, Moses’‏‎שְׁחִין ,שְׂאֵת‎ but also those of
the mucous membrane of the urethra (φύματα
ἔσωθεν,—abscesses on the inside) were affected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
exactly as is observed at the present day, especially
in the chronic forms of gonorrhœa.</p>

<p>The gonorrhœa then in this case would seem to
have been of a more malignant type and to have
been combined with ulceration. This best agrees
with the general delineation of the <i>epidemic condition</i>
as a whole, the exanthematic character of which
declared itself in the fig-like growths or tumours,—the
σῦκα αἰδοίοισιν (figs on the genitals). <i>Grimm</i>
(Vol. I. p. 490.) already remarks on this passage of
Hippocrates: “One might be tempted in this case
to regard the ulcerations of the genital parts and
their consequences, the fig-like tumours, as being the
first signs of disease due to incontinence. Indeed
what was there to hinder an evil of the sort in those
times and under a warm climate from signalizing
itself,—then subsequently so far losing its malignant
character that its nature was completely misunderstood?
Something of the same kind actually happens
under our own eyes in connection with this very
disease.”</p>


<h4 id="S_33">§ 33.</h4>


<p>Still more important were the effects of these
meteorological conditions on ulcers of the genitals
<i>already in existence</i>. We read (loco citato p. 482.):
“Even before the beginning of Spring, concurrently
with the commencement of the cold time, erysipelas
made frequent appearances sometimes with, sometimes
without, visible cause; it showed itself highly malignant
in type, and carried off many. Many again suffered
from painful affections of the pharynx (anginae,—sore
throats), loss of voice (affections of the wind-pipe),
inflammatory fevers with delirium, aphthae in
the mouth, φύματα (abscesses) in the genital organs,
ophthalmias, ἄνθρακες (malignant pustules), etc.—Also
many got erysipelas from external causes, at
such spots as these had happened to affect them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
even after the smallest injuries<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>, and in all parts of
the body. Above all sexagenarians suffered in this
way in the head, if they were treated in the smallest
degree carelessly. Even under careful and scientific
treatment wide-spread phlegmonous affections frequently
occurred, while the erysipelas spread to a
serious extent and with great rapidity in all directions.
In most of the patients so affected the metamorphosis
that succeeded was to ulcerations, whilst <i>muscles,
sinews and bones fell away to a serious degree</i>. But
the morbid product that collected did not resemble
ordinary matter (pus), but was a sort of putrid <i>sanies</i>,
occurring equally in combination and by itself<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>.
Such as were attacked in the head, became bald
over the whole head and chin, the bones were laid
bare and fell away, and such ῥεύματα (morbid
discharges) as described occurred frequently, whether
with or without fever. Symptoms of the kind however
were more terrifying than really destructive<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
for among patients in whom these (ῥεύματα) came
to maturity and resulted in suppuration, the majority
were saved; on the contrary many died among those
in whom the phlegmonous affections and the erysipelas
disappeared, without undergoing any such metamorphosis
into other forms of disease. Moreover
the same thing happened to those in whose case
(the morbid product) attacked some other part of
the body. For with many of them the whole upper
and fore arm fell away; while in some patients the
disease attacked the ribs, the sole difference being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
whether some destruction was wrought on their
anterior or posterior aspect; in others again the
whole thigh or the lower leg or the whole foot was
laid bare. <i>But the most dangerous of all was, when
this or the like happened in the neighbourhood of the
private parts or to the private parts themselves</i>, and
the mischief manifested itself in the form of ulcers,
and as the result of external causes. In many
patients suchlike symptoms occurred during, before,
as well as after the fever”<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>.</p>

<p><i>Galen</i>, who has left us a Commentary on this
passage (Vol. XVII. A.) mentions in the first place
that aphthae, φύματα (abscesses) of the genitals, etc.
specifically possessed (p. 661.) nothing of κακοηθεία
(malignity), but only when as in this case they
occurred in conjunction with a putrid general condition.
“The putrid character easily arises even without a
pestilential general condition, if the parts are attacked
by phlegmonous affections or erysipelas, and spreads
likewise over the neighbouring parts lying uppermost;
hence it is we are compelled after cutting away the
decayed tissues to cauterize the place. It is no
wonder then, when such a condition has arisen that
upper and fore-arm, thigh and lower leg, ribs and
head are attacked, if the private parts suffer above
all others.—So far the author has discussed those
affections of a kind akin to erysipelas which associate
themselves with ulcerations or other comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
insignificant external cause; in what follows he speaks
of such attacks as occurred without any such occasioning
cause”<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>.</p>

<p>Now if we examine these statements, so far as
they are of immediate interest in view of our object,
we may unhesitatingly conclude from them, that in
Hippocrates’time a large number of patients suffered
from ulcers of the genitals. These it seems under
the influence of the prevailing typhoïdal conditions
were assailed by inflammation of an erysipelas-like
type, rapidly passing over into humid gangrene,
which latter destroyed the parts attacked, readily
extended its ravages, and eventually killed the patient.
This is an observation which <i>Galen</i> likewise had
frequent occasion to make (so probably under the
head of Influence of the Climate of Asia, pp. 318,
326, 329.), without any exactly definite typhoïdal
conditions having been prevalent<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>, and even saw
himself under these circumstances very generally
constrained, in order to put a stop to the spread
of the mortification, <i>to amputate the gangrenous
tissue, and afterwards cauterize the wound</i>. What
was the origin of these ulcers of the genitals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
is indeed not stated; but it is certain they were not
invariably conditioned by the prevailing <i>genius
epidemicus</i>. Besides, since Hippocrates several times
mentions them without giving the cause that produced
them, it is a more likely conjecture to suppose that
this cause was one universally familiar (it consisted
in an act of unclean intercourse with women), than
to assume it to have been <i>absolutely unknown</i> to
physicians generally<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>.</p>

<p>Again the result of this investigation is of still
more especial interest in so far as it enables us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
properly appreciate Thucydides’notice of the so-called
<i>Plague of Athens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> This has been discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
by very many writers, and has given occasion to
the most widely different explanations. He relates
as follows: “For the disease which at first had its
stronghold in the head, beginning from above downwards
traversed by degrees the whole body; and
even supposing a patient to have escaped the worst,
yet a seizure of the extremities put its mark upon
him. For it attacked the genitals and the extremities
of the hands and feet; and many escaped death,
but with the loss of these parts.” Even more clearly
does the poet <i>Lucretius</i><a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> paint the disease, when
he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Profluvium porro qui tetri sanguinis acre</div>
  <div class="verse">Exierat; tamen in nervos huic morbus et artus</div>
  <div class="verse">Ibat et <em class="gesperrt">in partes genitales corporis ipsas</em>,</div>
  <div class="verse">Et graviter partim metuentes limina leti</div>
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Vivebant ferro privati virili</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Then too if any one had escaped the acrid discharge
of noisome blood, the disease would yet pass into
his sinews and joints and onward even <i>into the
sexual organs of the body</i>; and some from excessive
dread of the gates of death <i>would live bereaved of
these parts by the knife</i>. Munro’s translation).</p>

<p>Though we really are concerned only with the
last words of Thucydides, so far as they relate to
the genitals, yet what precedes has given occasion
to such extraordinary interpretations that we feel
bound to devote some attention to this as well.
The whole passage proved itself an especial <i>stone of
stumbling</i> to those writers who endeavoured to
identify the Athenian plague with <i>scarlet-fever</i>, as
<i>Malfatti</i> did, or with <i>small-pox</i>, like <i>Scuderi</i> and
<i>Kraus</i>. In fact this is why the last named says as
he does<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>: “The loss of the private parts and the
extremities (στερισκομενοι τουτων,—being deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of these, with the loss of these) would certainly
seem to point merely to the loss of the <i>free use</i> of
these parts, in consequence of ulcerations, swellings
of the joints, lesions and contractions, for the entire
members are not likely to have been destroyed by
mortification or amputated by the surgeon? Indeed
it is only in deference to the verses of Lucretius
that the latter opinion has become the one generally
held; but even Ancient commentators<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> have felt
that the Roman poet may very possibly have
mistaken Thucydides’meaning. Moreover I feel
myself disposed to agree with them particularly on
this ground, that the mortification of the whole of
any of the greater limbs, though it <i>has</i> been observed
in pestilential fevers, in <i>Typhus contagiosus putridus</i>
(putrid infectious Typhus) amongst others, yet makes
a comparatively rare symptom of the disease, and
at the same time so dangerous a one that it can
hardly be, as Thucydides alleges it was, that many
(πολλοὶ) after such a serious affection escaped death,
while on the contrary some (εἰσὶ δ’οἵ) only did so
with the loss of the eyes.” Any one who will
compare the just quoted passages of Hippocrates
and Galen with the account of Thucydides, will
want no further proof that as a matter of fact
mortification of the extremities did supervene, an
occurrence that even in later times<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> is not of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
extreme rarity that <i>Kraus</i> and others believe. Again
the fact that <i>many</i> of those attacked escaped with
their lives is the less surprising when one remembers
that Thucydides is not speaking of entire arms and
feet as having fallen off, but only of ἄκρας χεῖρας
καὶ πόδας, that is to say, fingers and toes. However
supposing any one to prefer not to supply
ἄκρων with τούτων, but take it as used in its full
extent, maintaining that hands and feet as well as
genitals were entirely destroyed, even this would
not belong to the category of <i>extremely rare</i> phenomena,
for Hippocrates actually saw the extremities
entirely fall off in similar circumstances, while if
only the ῥεύματα (morbid discharges) came duly
to maturity and maturation supervened, the major
part (οἱ πλεῖστοι τούτων ἐσώζοντο,—the majority
of these were saved) escaped with their life.</p>

<p>Finally the passage of Thucydides gives no sort
of evidence to prove that the ἀκρωτηρίων ἀντίληψις
(seizure of extremities) occurred solely in those
attacked by the fever as metastasis and so on. For
the first sentence quoted, to the effect that the
disease traversed the whole body, evidently refers
back to the preceding clause ἐπικατιόντος τοῦ
νοσήματος ἐς τὴν κοιλίαν (when the disease descends
into the abdomen), and for this reason is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
connected with it by the conjunction γὰρ—“for”. The
succeeding words καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν μεγίστων
περιγένοιτο (and even supposing a patient to have
escaped the worst) may very well be taken in this
way; μεγίστων (the greatest, worst things) is made
not a Neuter absolute, like τὰ ἔσχατα (last extremities)
and such like phrases in other places, but
κακῶν (evils) is supplied to go with it, and the
whole translated: “even supposing a patient escaped
the greatest evils”, that is to say if he were not
attacked by the λοῖμος (Plague) in the forms of
head and abdominal affections, “yet it marked him”,
that is it made its existence manifest by gangrene
of the extremities supervening<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>. This Thucydides,
a layman writing on a medical subject, supposes to
be a mere manifestation of the λοῖμος (Plague),
while Hippocrates regarded it as the proof of
the erysipelas-putrid condition, which caused the
already previously existing ulcers etc. to assume this
character.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the fact that at
Athens ulcers of the feet were of frequent occurrence;
and these must, no less than the ulcers of
the genitals previously existing in any case, have
necessarily been likewise assailed by the general
unhealthy condition of things, and when this happened,
have passed over into gangrene. Thucydides
in fact says expressly at the beginning of his delineation
of the disease (ch. 49.): τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔτος, ὡς
ὡμολογεῖτο, ἐκ πάντων μάλιστα δὴ ἐκεῖνο ἄνοσον
ἐς τὰς ἄλλας ἀσθενείας ἐτύγχανεν ὄν. εἰ δέ τις
καὶ προέκαμνέ τι, <em class="gesperrt">ἐς τοῦτο πάντα ἀπεκρίθη</em>.
(For indeed that year, as was universally admitted,
chanced to be of all years one especially free from
other diseases in general; and indeed if any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>one suffered previously from any complaint, <i>all
ended in this</i>, the plague.)” We have seen how Hippocrates
observed the prevalence of ulcers of the
genitals at the period of the special meteorological
conditions he drew attention to, and without doubt
in the same way such existed at Athens as well, and
were subsequently dominated by the prevailing
erysipelas-typhoïdal conditions. This was manifested
in one of two ways; either the ulcers became gangrenous,
or the patient was attacked by typhus,
precisely as is noted to be the case at the present
day<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>. But under either eventuality the existing
contagion was annihilated, in the one case by the
general feverish reaction of the organism<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>. But in
those cases where neither fever nor mortification
supervened, the contagion undoubtedly assumed a
more strongly effective character, was more readily
infectious, set up more deeply penetrating ulcerations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and the tendency towards the skin being the predominating
one, exanthematic eruptions with an
inclination to ulcerative forms (ἐκθύματα μεγάλα,
ἕρπητες πολλοῖσιν μεγάλοι,—great pustules, extensive
creeping eruptions in many cases) were observed
by Hippocrates to be set up in Summer, (loco citato
p. 487.). All these are factors of the highest importance
for the history of Venereal disease, as it is
only by them that we shall be enabled to solve the
great riddle of the origin of Venereal disease in the
XVth. Century,—a riddle to which the answer would
long ago have been found, if only enquirers had not
been in the habit almost down to our own days of
persistently looking upon Venereal disease as an
isolated phænomenon.</p>

<p>True it is impossible from the passage of
Thucydides to decide with any certainty whether
the extremities, hands, feet and genitals, fell off of
their own accord or were removed by the knife;
but our own opinion is that both was the case, for
of course there were Physicians at Athens, and until
they had learned their powerlessness against the
prevailing sickness, they no doubt employed the
remedial means at their disposal, and these consisted
according to Hippocrates solely and simply in the
use of scalpel and cauterizing iron, all other measures
having proved unavailing. That these were equally
resorted to in ulcerations of the genitals we see from
the passage of Galen quoted above, and the Poem
of the Priapeia, p. 74, confirms the same in the
most convincing way.</p>

<p>Enough has been alleged to prove how far the view
expressed in many different forms, to the effect that,
in the Athenian Plague as well as in the meteorological
conditions and their results as laid down by
Hippocrates, it is a question of Venereal disease, is
justified by facts, and to show that even in Antiquity
materials are to be found to demonstrate
conclusively that the <i>genius epidemicus</i> exercised a
not unimportant influence on the rise, form and course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of the ulcerations of the genital organs. In what
way this influence acted on the complaints consequent
on paederastia and the vices of the <i>cunnilingue</i>
and the <i>fellator</i> and affecting the posterior and
mouth, we cannot at any rate at the moment
demonstrate historically, but it seems only probable
that previously existing ulcerations in the mouth and
throat must under an erysipelas-typhoïdal general
condition have proved themselves in the highest
degree dangerous to the sufferers.</p>

<h3 id="S_34">§ 34.</h3>


<p>It has been fully proved in the course of our
previous investigations that Asia and Egypt must be
regarded as the two focus-points of exaggerated
sensual licence, the conditions of climate being most
favourable in those regions for the generation of
affections consequent upon sexual excesses. So it
may be fairly concluded without further proof that
in the same parts of the world attention was early
devoted to the problem how to render such influences,—no
mere passing ones, be it observed, but
continuously operative,—as little harmful as possible.
Now in what way could this end be more adequately
attained than by <i>cleanliness</i> carried out to the highest
possible degree? As a matter of history, the merest
superficial acquaintance with the customs and usages
of Antiquity clearly shows that equally in Asia and
in Egypt concern for bodily cleanliness had occupied
the particular attention of both political and sacerdotal
Legislators from the most remote period.
More than this, it had come to be looked upon by
the people as so entirely necessary, as to be all
but inextricably blended with their very life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
being. Any idea of vexatious compulsion entirely
disappeared, and the laws and ordinances directed
to this object are in force to this day as fully as
they were thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Inhabitants of the temperate zone who visited
these lands were bound to think,—unless they gave
more careful consideration to the subject than most
were likely to do,—such almost universal and such
scrupulous care for cleanliness exaggerated; and so
we find, e.g. the Greek writers, who cite many of
the usages of this description, invariably referring to
them merely as a sort of curiosity. In later times,
e.g. in <i>St. Athanasius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> they are even condemned
as being prompted by the Devil, in order to diminish
the amount of time to be devoted to pious exercises.
It may well be that in course of time a too scrupulously
precise dependence on ancestral custom
had brought many of these usages into ridicule,
especially when they were practised in countries
where in some cases the reasons for their observance
altogether cease to be operative. Yet anyone who
considers with due care the conditions under which
they were originally introduced, will find himself
constrained to admit that the Lawgiver was only
obeying a behest of necessity.</p>

<p>If the different customs and usages of the Ancients
in connection with their careful attention to cleanliness
are examined more minutely, they are found
to be divisible into two classes, according as (1.)
their object was to prevent uncleanliness, or (2.) to
banish it, when once admitted. All measures connected
with sanitary police supervision, the enforcement
of which in modern civilized States leads to
such endless difficulties, were almost entirely in the
hands of the Priests, to whom the People were
accustomed to accord an unquestioning obedience.
It was an easy matter therefore to prevent any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
injurious contamination from extending over a wide
area; it sufficed simply to declare unclean whatever
might prove injurious to health to ensure its being
avoided in practice,—and in the majority of instances
with the most scrupulous care. This is a factor in
the problem that appears never to have been properly
appreciated by our Historical Pathologists;
otherwise they must long ago have abandoned many
prejudices regarding the knowledge possessed by the
Ancients as to contagious matter. For how <i>could</i>
practical observations be collected on infection and
the liability to infection, when every possible chance
of infection was carefully and generally avoided?
Most of the Peoples of Antiquity considered contact
with a dead body a pollution, more than this, they
thought even the neighbourhood of a corpse to have
the same effect. They hung up notices to warn the
passers-by, and placed vessels of water (ἀδάνιον,
ὄστρακον, γάστρα—water-stoup, earthen vessel,
water-pot) before the house where a dead man lay,
that those who came in and out might be able to
purify themselves again on the spot<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>. Of course all
did not go so far as the Persians, who declared
every sick person unclean. Still it is a fact, and
this most certainly not merely among the Jews, that
all the various infectious skin-diseases that were
massed together under the name of Leprosy<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
also Gonorrhœa (Clap), made the sufferer, and also
everything he touched, unclean, and caused them
to be set apart where no one should come in contact
with them; and this continued so long as the
sickness lasted.</p>

<p>Now does it really need any further proof that
these diseases developed a perfectly well-known form
of contagious matter: or is an arbitrary and imaginary
theory to be adopted by preference, to the effect
that injunctions of the sort owed their existence
merely to the caprice of the Legislator, and were
not based on any actual experience of real detriment
resulting from their neglect in favour of others? At
any rate it is certain that, where these laws were in
force and where each individual followed them out
exactly, a disease that is communicable only by close
contact could not possibly be disseminated over any
wide area. This could not take place under such
circumstances, even though it had been engendered
in its original form and continued prevalent for a
long period of time.</p>

<p>However it was not only the sick that were
avoided, but all possible causes as well that might
lead to the disease. It was not only the effort
required and the pain, but most likely the possibility
also of injury resulting, that made the weakly
Asiatic forgo the <i>Jus primae noctis</i> (Right of the first
night), and declare unclean the supposed<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> injurious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
effects of the vaginal blood that flowed on the
rupture of the hymen, as well as the act of defloration
itself. Pollution was guarded against in
this case, as it was by the regulation banishing
women during the time of menstruation from the
neighbourhood of men, a regulation that had the
binding force of law amongst almost all the Nations
of Antiquity. The same held good for the time of
purification of women who had been lying-in,<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
a condition which was supposed in some unexplained
way to be able to exert a possibly injurious influence
on the genital organs of the husband.</p>

<small>§ 35.</small></h3>


<p>In spite of all this it might yet happen that
contact with a sick person could not be avoided,
and all possible causes of the diseases in question
escaped. Attention therefore was naturally directed
to the effort to make the admission of the contagion
and of matters having deleterious effects as difficult
as might be. There were two means for attaining
this end held to be especially effective,—depilation
and circumcision.</p>

<p>The hair as is well known is particularly apt to
attract and retain all kinds of moisture; and it will
of course do this in the case of the genital secretions,
whether healthy or morbid, if they come in
contact with it. These secretions will the more
readily exert an injurious effect, as each hair is
accompanied by at least two cutaneous glands, possessing
an excretory duct or pore, and in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
parts of the body where a thicker and stronger
growth of hair is found, develop a considerably
increased degree of activity,—an increased activity
which they exhibit in any case in hot countries.
“Hence too the Priests in Egypt shave the body
carefully; for there is something collects under
the hair, that must be removed,” <i>Philo</i> says
in a passage cited above, and a fragment of
<i>Theopompus</i> preserved by <i>Athenaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> also tells us, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
this habit existed also among the Greeks, as well
as among different peoples of Italy.</p>

<p>In later times however the habit gradually disappeared
in these countries; and is only found again
at the period of greatest luxury, when the Pathics
endeavoured by the removal of hair from all parts
of the body, except the head, to assimilate their
outward appearance to the feminine type<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>. Especially
were they bound to rid the posteriors<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> of hair,
as one penetrating into the anus during unnatural
connexion might easily cause small cuts at the orifice,
and produce chafings of the penis. For the same
reason paederasts, as indeed was the case with all
amateurs of Love, invariably took care to remove
all hair from the genitals<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>, to avoid endangering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the posterior and the private parts of their mistresses.
Even more than men, did <i>women</i> seek to remove
the hair from their private parts, as they do to this
day in the East. This appears never to have been
the case among the Jews; but in Asia and in Egypt
the custom was observed by all classes of the people,
and probably from those lands first spread into
Greece and Italy. It seems to have been adopted
very generally by Greek women;<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> but it was <i>especially</i>
hetaerae and “filles de joie”<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> who practised
local as well as general depilation. A similar state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
of things must have existed at Rome<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>, where older
women resorted to the removal of hair from the
genitals as a means of concealing their age<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
any case whether in Greece or in Italy the purpose
and special object of depilation seems to have been
soon lost sight of, and the practice to have been
still to some extent kept up merely as a matter of
fashion. Nevertheless it is a fact that the habit has
continued even down to modern times in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
countries, and is actually followed there to some
extent on the ground of cleanliness<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>.</p>

<p>Depilation is completed by the <i>polishing</i> of the
skin with pumice, etc., a treatment that made it very
much less liable to take up dirt of all kinds. This
and the <i>anointing</i> of the body, that commonly followed
it, as it did the bath (see later), guarded
against the introduction of foreign matter into the
tissues to an important extent, yet without interfering
with transpiration, which in southern countries takes
place more by the cutaneous glands than by the
sweat-pores. This fact goes some way to explain
how it was that the contagious plagues of Antiquity,
generally of a transient character, never properly
speaking acquired any wide extension, unless they
were carried along with the <i>Genius epidemicus</i> at the
same time; and that even the latter, as is the case
at the present day, could seldom master and reverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
endemic predispositions. This last consideration
merits the particular attention of the Historical
Pathologist, as giving him a partial indication why
Antiquity comes so far behind later times in regard
to startling epidemics, at the same time teaching him
to regard Asia as the home of Endemic, Europe of
Epidemic Diseases. This ought to safeguard him
against many over-hasty conclusions in his views of
the progressive developement and evolution of disease
in general. At the same time it will undoubtedly
destroy not a few agreeable dreams, where he has
allowed imagination to outrun reality.</p>


<h3>Circumcision<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>.<br />

<small>§ 36.</small></h3>


<p><i>Herodotus</i> himself represents circumcision as a very
ancient usage even in his time, as to which it is a
moot point whether the Egyptians or Ethiopians first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
practised it. From the Egyptians it would seem to
have passed on to the Phoenicians and Syrians in
Palestine, from the Colchians to the Syrians living
on the banks of the river Thermodon and Parthenius
and to the Macronians<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>. To the present day we
find Circumcision practised, as all the world knows,
among the Mohammedans, Persians and Jews, among
the Kaffirs on the South-East Coast of Africa, the
Abyssinian Christians<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>, the inhabitants of the Pacific
Islands<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>, as well on the mainland of America,—and
this not merely among the coast dwellers, but also
in several inland districts of South America<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Without in this place going into the different
reasons that have been alleged to account for the
original introduction of Circumcision, especially among
the Jews, we may yet say, looking back to our
previous exposition in § 29., that we hold ourselves
bound to see in Circumcision originally a religious-hygienic
measure, intended to guard a part of the
body already in the earliest times held in such high
honour among the Egyptians, Indians etc. as was the
penis, against any probable chance of defilement by
uncleanliness (sebaceous smegma on the <i>glans penis</i>);
for it was found that the uncurtailed prepuce made
the maintenance of a clean <i>glans penis</i> much more
difficult, favouring as it did the collection of the
smegma resulting from the sebaceous secretions, and
thus gave occasion for the formation of pustules and
ulcers and the like inconveniences. These were
referred not to the natural cause, but rather looked
upon as a deserved punishment due to the anger of
the offended deity to whom the penis was sacred,
the deity being himself defiled and made unclean
by the uncleanliness of the organ. To escape such
anger men were ready enough to remove a part,
the direct utility of which was as little obvious at
the first glance as that of the hair that grew in its
neighbourhood,—a proceeding they were the more
willing to agree to, as the mischief the uncurtailed
prepuce occasioned was often enough manifested.</p>

<p>At first only the Priests, who of course were at
the same time the Physicians of primitive Peoples,
were allowed to undertake the performance of this
operation; subsequently it devolved upon the people
generally as well, either by direct command or
because they were now convinced of the utility of
circumcision. This utility however must have grown
less and less frequently visible in proportion as fewer
uncircumcised individuals were left in evidence; and
so in the same degree the hygienic motive fell more
and more into the background. Thus only the
religious was left, and this was now taken as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
sole reason and sufficient explanation of the universal
custom. Circumcision accordingly came to be a
symbol signifying adoption among such as were
initiated into the Egyptian Mysteries, and similarly
adoption among the initiated of the Lord, adoption
into the peculiar People of God. It is in this fashion
the various discordant views as to the origin of
circumcision, all of which proceeded in the first
instance from a more or less one-sided point of view,
may most satisfactorily be brought into agreement.
True the motive for the operation was supplied by
a pathological factor, but one which owed its force
to a religious idea, and thus at first the knife was
regarded not so much from the <i>physician’s</i> point of
view as from the <i>religious</i> side.</p>

<p>But again later, when religious ideas of the sort
were more and more disappearing before a cool
examination of actual nature, when the tale of
diseases originating in the anger of a deity was
growing every day fewer, belief became impossible
in the religious meaning of circumcision, or indeed
such belief was deliberately rejected, now that a
clear and natural explanation of the rite was to be
found. The religious motive in turn made way for
the medical-hygienic, as in <i>Philo</i> in the passage
quoted above, and even Our Lord seems to
have held no other view of the rite, when he says<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>:
“If a man received circumcision on the sabbath,
that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye
wroth with me, because I <i>made a man every whit
whole</i> on the sabbath?” <i>De Wette</i> in his Translation
adds: “that is to say, not simply, as in circumcision,
in one member, but in the whole body.” In fact
the question is here of the healing of the man “which
had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity”
(Ch. V.), whom Christ had made whole at the Pool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
of Bethesda on the Sabbath, for which reason the
Jews wished to put him to death. The sick man
was afflicted in his whole body, i. e. in every limb,
for without help he could not leave his bed and go
down into the Pool. Thus Christ we see contrasts
the healing of all the members with circumcision,
making it plain that in his view the latter makes
whole merely a single member, the penis, or at
least puts it in such a condition that it cannot
become sick (ὑγιῆ ἐποίησα,—I made whole); accordingly
the rite possessed for him only a purely medico-hygienic
aim.</p>

<p>As to the introduction of Circumcision among the
Jews, this may very likely, as we have already
pointed, have taken place in the following mode:
Evidently the Jews when in Egypt were not
yet circumcised, as the speech of the lord Joshua
clearly implies, “This day have I taken the reproach
of Egypt from off you;” for in the eyes of the
Egyptians the uncircumcised condition of the Jews
was a reproach, just as in later times “Uncircumcised”
was the strongest word of abuse with the
Jews themselves.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Moses brought up by the Egyptian
Priests, initiated into their secret wisdom, must
necessarily have been circumcised, and so have
known the hygienic as well as religious point of
view. Convinced of its expediency, he determined
to introduce it among the Jews, in order to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
them by outward sign in some sort a holy and pure
priestly Nation.<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> For this reason we find the command
to circumcise on the eighth day after birth
specified among the <i>Laws of Purification</i>,<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> yet
without any further supplemental addition,—which
would certainly not have been omitted, if it had at
that time been regarded as a symbolic sign of covenant.
Circumcision did not yet possess its purely
symbolic meaning; and so it is not yet included
among the laws given at Sinai, where the blood of
the Burnt Offerings seals the covenant with God.</p>

<p>But subsequently when the Jews at Shittim gave
themselves to the licentious worship of Baal Peor,
not merely the expediency stood out in glaring
conspicuousness, but the positive necessity of observing
the laws of purity in general, including that of
circumcision in particular. Thus the long conceived
idea of Moses came to maturity, to enjoin upon the
People the rite of circumcision as special symbol of
unity with Jehovah; though he could not hope to
bring about its universal adoption by adults, until
these were on the point of actually setting foot on
the Promised Land. This could only be after the
death of Moses; consequently it was Joshua at
Arolath who first circumcised all those who had
been born in the Wilderness. Now all the sufferings
of the march were forgotten, the land flowing with
milk and honey, that was to content all their highest
wishes, lay before their eyes, and so they were
willing enough to consent to purchase its everlasting
possession at the cost of what is certainly a painful,
but at the same time on the whole only a trifling,
operation. But then when every male was circumcised,
there was no longer any evidence, as explained
above, to convince people of the necessity
of the observance, and thus for the future Circumcision
appeared in the guise of a <i>purely</i> religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
symbol, as the sacramental outward and visible sign
of adoption into sonship with Jehovah,—a point of
view subsequently consistently kept to throughout
the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Finally with regard to the notion, expressed in
many different forms, that Circumcision was originally
introduced on behalf of increased fruitfulness
on the part of the Sons of Abraham,<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>—an idea
found as early as in the pages of <i>Philo Judaeus</i>, it
would appear not to be so much the greater length
of the foreskin that came into question, but rather
the same general reasons that ensured a condition
of cleanliness in the procreative organs; for the
alleged interruption of the ejaculation of the semen
owing to the excessive length of the foreskin can
after all only occur, if the latter is at the same
time unduly contracted at its orifice in such a way
that during the act of coition it cannot be drawn
back over the <i>glans</i>. Supposing, as we have seen
to be the case, complaints affecting the <i>glans penis</i>
when covered with the normal prepuce to be readily
set up through climatic influences, the free use of
the organ of procreation must of course in this way
have been interfered with, or even in extreme cases,
completely prevented. But inasmuch as the Jew,
in this resembling most of the Nations of Antiquity,
made a numerous posterity his highest glory,<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and
as this could only be obtained on the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
a healthy procreative member, every endeavour
must obviously have been made to remove anything
likely to be prejudicial to the part so profoundly
reverenced, anything capable of disturbing, or even
altogether frustrating, the due performance of its
functions.</p>

<p>But just as this removal of a part of the prepuce,
and the consequent increased possibilities of cleanliness
of the <i>glans</i>, more or less counteracted the
injurious effects of Climate tending to set up diseases
of the <i>glans penis</i> in general, it must have equally
exercised as against possible affections of this part
resulting from coition a certain prophylactic influence,—though
undoubtedly this was not <i>so</i> great as it
has been in some quarters represented to be, as
we intend to explain more fully elsewhere. Hence
to some extent, but only to a limited extent, can
the practice of circumcision be regarded as a proof
of the existence of Venereal disease in Antiquity;
but at the same time to refer it to this as <i>sole</i>
motive, as <i>Stoll</i><a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> does, is quite inadmissible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>What has here been said of <i>the Circumcision of
men</i>, holds good also in the main of <i>that of maids
and women</i>. This consists in the removal of the
<i>praeputium clitoridis</i>; but neither the amputation
of the Clitoris itself in so-called <i>Tribads</i> must
be confounded with it, nor yet the operation on the
exaggerated nymphae or inner <i>labia</i>, of women. The
Arabs, among whom this practice,—female circumcision,—is
especially rife at the present day as it
was of old,<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> call the part that is subjected to circumcision<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">نوي (<i>nava</i>), the circumcision itself&nbsp; خفض (<i>battar</i>)</span><br />

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">بظر (<i>bätr</i>). Usually the circumcision of maids</span><br />
is first performed on the completion of the tenth
year by women who make it their special business
and who are known as  مبظّرة (<i>mobatterat</i>). These
women perambulate the streets and openly call out,
“Any maids to circumcise?”<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Besides the Arabs,
Circumcision of maids is to be found among the
Copts or modern Egyptians,<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> the Ethiopians,<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> in
some districts of Persia,<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> among the Negroes in
Bambuk<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> and the Panos in the province of Maynas
in South America, the latter actually restricting the
practice to the women.<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>In spite of all precautions adopted it was impossible
to keep away everything unclean from the body,
while this latter by its own excrements was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
constantly making itself more or less unclean;<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
it was only natural that from the most primitive
times men’s attention was directed towards means
of removing the uncleanliness so contracted. But
the defilement was never more than an external one;
it concerned merely the skin and the orifices of the
mucous membrane, while the matter requiring removal
was of a sort soluble in water, and thus water was
always the chief and foremost means employed to
secure cleanliness. Doctrines of Cosmogony further
confirmed the practice; these made water the origin
of all things, a direct effluence of the deity and
therefore itself divine,—a means not only of purification,
but of sanctification as well.</p>

<p>(The sea washes away all evils of mankind) was the
refrain, one that resounds to this day in our ears
from the East; so that we cannot wonder that baths
and bathing formed a capital factor both in the
public and private life of the Ancients. Whatever
view might be taken of sexual intercourse, all agreed
in this, that a certain defilement was connected with
it, which (as follows indeed from our exposition on
earlier pages) might easily become injurious to the
organs brought into activity, and could only be
obviated by dint of <i>baths</i> and a system of <i>bathing</i>.<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Thus we read in <i>Herodotus</i>:<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> “But as often as a
<i>Babylonian</i> has had intercourse with his wife, he
sits down beside a lighted censer, and his wife does
the same on the opposite side; then when morning
has come, both <i>bathe</i> themselves, for they will touch
no vessel until they have washed. The same practice
is followed by the <i>Arabians</i> too.” Whether
bathing after <i>each</i> act of coition was a national
custom of the <i>Egyptians</i>, we have been unable to
discover, but <i>Clement of Alexandria</i><a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> states that they
were forbidden, as was almost everywhere the case
in Antiquity, to enter the temple without having
washed or bathed themselves after sexual intercourse;
while the Priests were bound to bathe after every
nocturnal pollution.<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> This was equally an ordinance
of the <i>Jews</i>, who at the same time were rendered
by such pollution unclean till the evening. The last
named People were also obliged to wash after every
act of coition; at any rate <i>Josephus</i><a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> and <i>Philo</i><a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
declare it to have been so, for in the Old Testament
it is nowhere enjoined. As is generally known, this
custom has been kept up in the East down to the
present day, even among the Christian populations,—affording
a concurrent testimony to the necessity for
its observance in these countries.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>Greeks</i> deliberately and with intention
made use of baths and bathing immediately after
sexual intercourse, it is difficult to ascertain quite
for certain; but it seems probable, as not only does
Mythology more than once<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> make express mention
of the bath after coition, but the phrase ὅσιος ἀπ’
εὐνᾶς ὤν (being holy, purified, after the couch)
points to the same conclusion. Moreover there is
a passage in <i>Lucian</i>,<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>—though it is quite true he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
often describes Roman customs,—that might be
thought to prove the same.</p>

<p>Clearer indications are forthcoming in the case of
the <i>Romans</i>, who not only must not undertake any
sacred function or enter a Temple, if they had failed
to bathe after carrying out coition,<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> but were also
bound generally after every act of cohabitation to
wash the parts brought into use. At any rate this
holds good of the women, and so applies to the
Roman matron (comp. the passage of <i>Suetonius</i> quoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
in § 27) as to Atia, the mother of Augustus, as well as in
an even greater degree to the amica (mistress) or courtesan.
The regular name for this was <i>aquam sumere</i>
(to take water).<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Indeed there were actually special
attendants <i>aquarioli</i> (water-boys),<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> whose business it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
was not merely to fetch water for this purpose, but also in particular to bathe and cleanse the “filles de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
joie” after sexual intercourse. For this reason <i>Lampridius</i>
says of the Emperor Commodus (ch. 2),
<i>aquam gessit, ut lenonum ministeriis probrosis natum
magis, quam in loco crederes, ad quem fortuna pervexit</i>
(he fetched water, so that you would more readily
suppose him born to perform the shameful offices
of pandars than in the station whereto fortune raised
him). Such cleanliness was especially obligatory on
those who had to do with the preparation of food
and drink, such as bakers, cooks and butlers;<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> and
if we do not find it directly enjoined among many
ancient Peoples, the only reason of this is that they
were already accustomed to wash and bathe every
morning<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> immediately on leaving their bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>In the same way as after natural coition the parts
brought into use were bathed and washed, this was
also done after <i>unnatural</i>, and so we read in the
Collection of Priapeia (Carm. 40.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Falce minax et parte tui maiore, Priape,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Ad fontem, quaeso, dic mihi qua sit iter?</div>
  <div class="verse">Vade per has vites, quarum si carpseris uvas</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Quas aliter sumas, hospes, habebis aquas—</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Standing in threatening attitude with my bristling
pruning-knife and your better part, Priapus, I enquire:
“Pri’thee tell me, which is my way to the fountain?”
“Go through yonder vines, but if you dare to pluck
the grapes, you will find, stranger, <i>water you must
take</i> elsewhere”). Clearly this is to be taken as
meaning paederastia or irrumation looked upon as
punishments inflicted for the theft contemplated;
and shows us at the same time it was not without
a “double entendre” that Priapus was set up as a
direction-post to fountains, a point that <i>Lomeier</i><a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
has already brought out with perfect correctness.
Again the <i>fellator</i> after his work used to cleanse
the mouth with water, as we learn from several
passages in <i>Martial</i>; thus amongst other places we
read in one, of Lesbia,<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Quod fellas et aquam potes, nil Lesbia peccas,</div>
  <div class="verse">Qua tibi parte opus est, Lesbia, sumis aquam.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(You <i>fellate</i> and then drink water; you do no wrong
in this, Lesbia; where lies your work, there Lesbia
you <i>take water</i>).</p>

<p>If we further add to this scrupulous cleanliness
the quiet life led by the women of Antiquity, who
spent most of their time, as women still do in the
East, reclining, it is evident that in spite of the
predisposing influence of Climate, injurious secretions
from the vagina and uterus, or indeed ulcerations of
these parts, must—speaking generally, and in proportion—have
occurred but rarely. Moreover such
maladies of the sort as were contracted were quickly
got rid of again spontaneously, for very often even
at the present day rest and cleanliness suffice by
themselves for the removal of primary affections of
the genitals. On the other hand it cannot be denied
that a careless non-observance of these primeval
laws of cleanliness must have then avenged itself
all the more severely on the offending individual,
and given occasion for the setting up of incurable
diseases.</p>

<p>But great as the counteracting effect of the frequent
use of baths in Antiquity was on the rise of diseases
in general, and of those resulting from sexual excesses
in particular, none the less in other ways did these
same baths, directly or indirectly, <i>give occasion for
their rise and spread</i>. As to their <i>direct</i> effect in
this direction,—we certainly find but scanty evidence
of any in the authorities, and even such as <i>are</i>
forthcoming may very possibly be referred to the
head of general want of cleanliness<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>. Still in view
of the fact that at the present day the cellar baths
of the Jews contribute to some degree to the spread
of disease, and especially of skin-disease of different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
types, as did baths generally in the Middle Ages,
the conjecture is surely justified that similar results
followed in Antiquity, especially at Rome under the
Emperors.</p>

<p><i>Indirectly</i> maladies consequent upon sexual excesses
were helped on by the mere fact that the ancient
Baths afforded manifold opportunities for such
excesses. The bath-attendants, or <i>aquarioli</i> (water-boys),
who fetched the water for bathing, not only
carried on vicious practices with the women frequenting
the place themselves, but also made a business of procuration,
as already pointed out just above, p. 214. The
lascivious Roman Ladies took their own slaves with
them to the Baths, that they might attend upon
their mistresses.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> At first the same bathing Establishments
were used equally by both sexes, but
not at the same time; and according to <i>Dio Cassius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
<i>Agrippa</i> would appear to have first, 721 A. U. C.,
established the public Baths at Rome for men and
women, from which place later on Baths open to
both sexes were introduced into Greece, as <i>Plutarch</i><a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
states. The Greeks called these Establishments
ἀνδρόγυνα λούτρα (men-women, male-female, baths),
and used to set up an image of Hermaphroditus in
front of them.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> In the Imperial period, when all
shame was laid aside and Heliogabalus himself
<i>in balneis semper cum mulieribus fuit</i> (always visited
the Baths in company of the women) (<i>Lampridius</i>
ch. 2), the use of the Baths both by men and
women, and this at the same time, had become an
established custom, as may be seen from several
passages of <i>Martial</i>;<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> and it was in vain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Emperors <i>Hadrian</i>,<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> <i>Marcus Antoninus</i><a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> and <i>Alexander
Severus</i><a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> endeavoured to restrain the abuse by enactments.
These were just as unavailing as were the
invectives of the Fathers of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>The Bathing Apartments, from which antique
Roman modesty had excluded almost every glimmer
of external light, were now patent to the eyes of
the passer-by. Fitted up with every device of the
most refined luxury,<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> they were transformed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
regular brothels;<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> and accordingly were not allowed
to open their doors earlier than one hour before the
ordinary establishments of this nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>The same opportunities which the Baths gave for
vice with women, they afforded no less for vice
between men,—for paederastia. There it was that
amateurs looked about for <i>bene vasatos</i> and καλλιπύγους,
(men with fine instruments, men with handsome
buttocks), and this among the Greeks as well
as among the Romans,<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> though the latter in this as
in other things beat the record of all other nations.</p>

<small>Relation of the Physician to Diseases
consequent upon the Use or Misuse
of the Genital Organs.</small></h2>


<h3 id="S_38">§ 38.</h3>


<p>In the preceding Sections we have become
acquainted with the various influences capable of
favouring or counteracting the rise of diseases consequent
upon the use or misuse of the genitals in
Antiquity. At the same time we have shown how
a multitude of affections of the most different kinds
attacked, as a result of the unnatural gratification of
sexual desire, those parts which under these circumstances
had to undertake the rôle of the genital
organs of the one or the other sex. Thirdly we
have brought forward in the course of the enquiry
at any rate some examples, proving beyond a doubt
that the sexual parts themselves too under favourable
external conditions sometimes became diseased as
the consequence of indulgence in sexual intercourse.
Still these results were for the most part based on
the evidence of non-medical Writers, for of set
purpose we abstained as much as possible from
calling the professional Writers into Court on these
points, so as to be able to treat in their proper
mutual connexion whatever statements these latter
have left us as to the maladies in question. This
course appeared to us all the more necessary, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
is precisely the medical evidence which the opponents
of the existence of Venereal disease in Antiquity
believe themselves able to utilize in justification of
their opinions.</p>

<p>But before we proceed to the detailed examination
of the actual statements, it would seem expedient to
get an answer to the following question: <i>whether
indeed the Physicians of Antiquity generally were in
a position to acquire an adequate knowledge of the
bodily consequences of vicious living?</i> In fact on the
correct answer to this question obviously depends
the correct appreciation of the medical Writings as
sources for the History of Venereal disease. Only
under the condition that this question may be
answered in the affirmative, can the evidence supplied
by the Physicians be regarded as satisfactory for
their own period. That it cannot of course be so
for all periods, has been pointed out already in our
examination of the authorities for Antiquity generally.
Indeed for long periods of time Physicians had no
special <i>locus standi</i>, inasmuch as each individual
in the case of the most usual maladies endeavoured
to help himself, and if the family recipes left him
stranded, then betook himself with prayers for
assistance to the Gods and their intermediaries on
earth, the Priests. This still continued, even after
the Physicians had won their recognition as a special
profession, and we find accordingly throughout
Antiquity popular, sacerdotal, and professional or
<i>medical</i> medicine, if we may be allowed the expression,
continuing to exist simultaneously side by side,
and not a trace anywhere of the ridiculous limitation
according to which no man has a right to be well
without the help of a doctor.</p>

<p>Now having made it clear by what we have said,
that in order to gain knowledge of a disease in Antiquity
it is by no means enough to go to the Physicians
only, even when such existed, that the latter should
never be regarded as sole possessors of whatever
was known from the point of view of pathology and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
therapeutics, we are bound to apply the same rule
in the case of diseases consequent upon vicious
habits. Of this the foregoing Sections contain amply
sufficient proofs. It has there been shown how the
genital organs were under the protection of special
deities. Diseases affecting them were ascribed to
the vengeance of the said deities, as at Athens to
Dionysus, at Lampsacus to Priapus. To them
sufferers had recourse to win by their prayers
the removal of the divine anger, as well as its
consequences; and all this happened not only in
times when Physicians did not as yet exist, but no
less when they did and in defiance of them, as the
poems of the Priapeia sufficiently prove.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> How long
these ideas lived on is shown by the pictures <i>Philo</i>
(p. 315) and <i>Palladius</i> (p. 318) draw of their times,
while the XVth. and XVIth. Centuries reproduced
the same scenes.</p>

<p>The most obvious reason for this no doubt was
the <i>enigma presented by the origin</i> of diseases of the
genitals, particularly for any one unacquainted with
the existence of contagions and their modes of
activity. The man who with a healthy penis had
accomplished coition, observed some days afterwards,
though without resenting the fact, a mucous discharge
to have been set up, or an ulcer, pustule, or what
not, to have appeared. The cause of these affections
he sought for in vain, for of course the mere act of
coition was the very last thing he was likely to
regard as such. Rather accustomed, wherever the
cause of any phænomenon was unknown to him, to
ascribe it to the intervention of the deity, he saw
in his complaint likewise the Θεῖον (divine) as
eventual cause. Naturally therefore it was divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
assistance, and not human, that would avail to relieve
him of his pain. Long after this time moreover,
when men had ceased to refer all diseases to the
vengeance of the gods, and now discovered natural
causes for maladies of the genitals, as for other
diseases, anything rather than just the act of coition
was looked upon as cause of the observed effects,
as indeed is the case to this day among the Turks,<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
and as the earliest Writers on Venereal disease
abundantly show to have been so in their time.
That the Physicians were no exceptions to this rule,
we shall show on a later page.</p>

<p>A much more weighty reason however why the
patient attacked by some affection of the genitals
turned not to men (Physicians) for help, but to the
Gods, and the Priests who represented them, was
the feeling of <i>shame</i>. Since first Adam and Eve
had recourse to the fig-leaf, it has ever been a habit
among all peoples of the ancient as of the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
world to withdraw the procreative parts from the
view of others by covering them. But above all did
the Ancients regard the exposure of these parts<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
one of the severest trials to which modesty could
be exposed; and rightly enough therefore designate
them by the name of <i>pudenda</i>, αἰδοῖα, <i>the parts of
shame</i>. Neither the wide extension of Phallic worship,
nor yet the compulsory exposure of the Ephebi<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> and
the naked exercises of maidens and youths at Sparta<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
can fairly be cited in this connexion as proofs to
the contrary.</p>

<p>In our own day the most accomplished voluptuaries
are in no wise shocked at undertaking in secret
the most shameful doings, but yet when it comes
to showing the Physician the diseased instruments
of their bestial lusts, often put this off so long as to
run great risks of entirely losing the signs of their
manhood; and without a doubt it was the same at
the period when habitual depravity had reached its
culminating point of enormity. Even Priapus himself
asks (Carm. 3):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Nec mihi sit crimen, quod mentula semper operta est.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Nor let it be laid as a crime against me, that my
member is ever covered up.) If with this is compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the poem from the Priapeia quoted on p. 74 of Vol. I.,
no one can fail to agree with us when we say that the
field of observation open to Physicians in Antiquity
with regard to diseases of the genitals can never
have been at all extended. Even the Priests, at any
rate in later times, were only resorted to in the more
serious instances; but even so their journals of cases,
supposing them ever to have kept such, would have
been a far better source of information than those
of the Physicians. We find a confirmation of this
in the Mosaic Books of the Law, which contain
the earliest and clearest delineations we possess of
affections of the genital organs both in men and
women.</p>

<p>But if men were so reluctant, how much more so
must women have been, who were universally held
to have committed a crime if they had given any
part of their body to the eyes of a stranger. Just
as the assistance of the Physician was disdained in
childbirth, and to account for the fact the fable of
Agnodicé invented, in the same way in complaints
of the genitals women hesitated to submit themselves
to the inquisition of the Physician. But seeing the
female sexual organs are pre-eminently the home and
breeding place of Venereal disease, this closed what
was precisely the most direct way to a correct understanding
of maladies of the genitals. The ancient
Physicians, like our own forefathers, could at best
make leucorrhœa the universal scape-goat; and accordingly
even <i>Galen</i>, as we shall find presently, laid
no stress on the circumstance, and drew no inference
from it, that wherever men were attacked by gonorrhœa,
the women with whom they had had coition
likewise suffered from the complaint.</p>

<p>Further, to this general sense of shame was added
a certain timidity before the professional status of
real Physicians as a class, as well as the pretty universally
prevalent idea of the <i>ignominiousness of a
sickness brought on by a person’s own fault</i>, at any
rate among the educated part of the population.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
This comes out in the following passage of <i>Plato</i>,<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
where he says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> “Does it appear to you disgraceful
to stand in need of medical help, when it is not
wounds at all or such sicknesses as depend on the
seasons that have befallen, but when a man through
indolence and a way of life such as we have noted
(i.e. a very luxurious one), is filled full of fluxes and
accumulations of wind like a sea, giving occasion to
the noble sons of Asclepius to designate these complaints
by the names of superfetations and catarrhs?”
This was more than a mere expression of individual
opinion; there is no doubt affections of the genital
organs, more especially if their relation to sexual
intercourse was known, belonged to the class of
diseases held to be most disgraceful,<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> and the Poet
is justified in saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Diis me legitimis nimisque magnis</em></div>
  <div class="verse">Ut Phoebo puta, filioque Phoebi</div>
  <div class="verse"><em class="gesperrt">Curatum dare mentulam verebar</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(To the lawful gods, deities too exalted for me, such
for instance as Phoebus, and Phoebus’son, I feared
to entrust my member for cure.) Thus it was not
to the “noble sons of Asclepius”, in other words
the Physicians, who treated freemen only, that
patients resorted for help, but to the gods, or else
to the medical underlings (ὑπηρέται τῶν ἰατρῶν,—subordinate
assistants of the physicians), to the slave-doctors
and quacks, who plied their trade in
the doctor’s shops,—establishments where, as we
have seen above, paederasts and pathics foregathered.
Exactly the same state of things prevailed
down to the middle of the last Century; and to this
day a majority of such sufferers rarely as a matter
of fact come under any other hands.</p>

<p>The knowledge and observations of these Cullers of
simples and Compounders of balsams, if indeed as
a rule they really possessed the former, or knew how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
to make the latter, necessarily perished on their
decease, or at best were passed on by tradition to
their successors in the doctor’s shops, without professional
Physicians or medical Science being one
whit advantaged. To such men it was a matter of
perfect indifference what was the origin of the disease
for which they sold their powders and decoctions,
for as <i>Plato</i> (De legg. IV. 720) says, they paid no
attention to the existing conditions of disease, and
did not care to give a thought to any such thing.
But at any rate,—and this was the chief point,—the
patient was spared a humiliating confession, and was
glad enough to buy the privilege even at the cost
of possible ruin to his health. We must further
remember that the “filles de joie” in Greece and
at Rome were mostly slave-women, who from the
very fact of their status could make no claim to
treatment by free-born physicians, and that during the
flourishing period of Greek medicine under the Hippocratic
school it was chiefly persons of the lowest
station or else sailors and foreign traders and the
like who sought enjoyment in the arms of prostitutes.
Such men by their constant change of abode made
all continued observation a simple impossibility, so
that the very imperfect knowledge possessed by the
scientifically trained Physicians with regard to diseases
of the genitals and their consequences need
occasion little surprise.</p>

<p>It is true of course that at the period of universal
degradation of morals Physicians must have found
no lack of opportunities for observation; but the
great majority of them were incapable of utilizing
these, actually blocked the way of set purpose, as
we shall see presently, that led in the direction of
more accurate investigation, or else troubled their
heads little about the cultivation of Science or the
systematic record of observations. The latter, if they
had published them, whether in writing or orally,
could only have been detrimental, particularly in the
case of physicians of the character of Charidemu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>s’
medical attendant,<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> to their own interests. In fact
they were bound to call all their subtlety into play
for the express purpose of concealing the true cause
of diseases of this type, a circumstance which no
doubt we have to thank for a large number of the
extravagant and often more than ludicrous statements
regarding the origin of Venereal disease in the XVth.
and XVIth. Centuries.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact the public itself was no
less careful to guard the secret, as we gather from
<i>Martial</i>,<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> as well as from the fact that <i>Galen</i> felt
himself constrained even in his day to compose a
special Treatise on dissimulated diseases. This sort
of intentional deception on the part of patients was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
so much the easier, as Physicians in those times,
as said above, in virtue of their pathological views,—some
of which indeed may very well have originated
in this way,—were little accessible to the truth. For
these reasons they deserved, at any rate to some
degree, the satiric lash of Martial; and were very
generally ridiculed by the more discerning of the
laity. This comes out in the important words of
<i>Appuleius</i> (Metamorph. X. 211.) as follows: “Crederes
et illam fluctuare tantum vaporibus febrium: nisi
quod et flebat: <em class="gesperrt">Heu medicorum ignavae
mentes!</em> Quid venae pulsus, quid caloris intemperantia,
quid fatigatus anhelitus et utrimque secus
iactatae crebriter laterum mutuae vicissitudines?
<em class="gesperrt">Dii boni! Quam facilis, licet non
artifici medico, cuivis tamen docto
venereae cupidinis comprehensio</em>,
cum videas aliquem sine corporis calore flagrantem.”
(Could you imagine her so tempest-tossed by the
vapours of mere fever,—not to mention that she
kept forever crying: “<i>Oh! the sorry wits of doctors!</i>”
What means the throbbing vein, the excessive
temperature, the labouring breath, and the hurried
interchange of heaving flank, panting now on one
side now on the other? <i>Great heavens! how easy
the diagnosis, not of course for a medical expert,
but for any one learned in the symptoms of love</i>,
when you see a person burning, yet without bodily
fever-heat).</p>

<p>But does all this justify us in casting a stone at
our medical colleagues of Ancient times? For the
last three hundred years we imagine ourselves clearly
acquainted with Venereal disease and all its forms;
yet how many a bubo has been mistaken for a
strangulated hernia, anal callosity, or the like, how
many a case of vaginal gonorrhœa for simple <i>fluor
albus</i> (white discharge, leucorrhœa), how many a
condyloma on the posteriors for hæmorrhoidal
swellings, and accordingly not treated as the physician
in <i>Juvenal</i>, <i>medico ridente</i> (the physician grinning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
while), treated them,—that is duly cut away or
ligatured?</p>

<p>Lastly to all these reasons was added further the
<i>mildness and absence of danger characterizing the disease</i>
itself, at any rate in the majority of instances,—as
proved in our earlier investigations. To our own
day genuine amateurs of Love, thanks to those who
supply “advice, direction and information” on these
subjects, endeavour as a rule, at any rate in the
earlier stages, to cure without assistance the wounds
received in the fight. This was equally so in Antiquity,
as the following significant passage of <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
shows: “This is pretty well all I have to say at
present as to ephemeral fevers. For <i>patients who have
contracted fever consequent upon a bubo, do not consult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
physicians as to what they must do; but after first
treating the ulcer which occasioned the bubo and then
the bubo itself</i>, bathe after the abatement of the
severity of the attack. After that if any one says
a word as to the “diatriton” (fast till the third day),
all laugh and declare him a precisian: I suppose
because they are of the opinion that nothing must
be resigned to nature that is not invariably there.”</p>

<p>We know quite well that the Ancients called all
glandular swellings buboes, and that they were perfectly
well acquainted<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> with those glandular swellings
in the arm-pits and the groin which follow upon
ulcers of the fingers and toes; but this in no way
justifies us in referring the above passage, which is
certainly written in a general sense, <i>solely</i> to suchlike
buboes and not equally to those in the soft tissues;
more particularly as <i>Galen</i>, in the place where he is
dealing expressly with the treatment of buboes and
the phlegmonous affections preceding them and
occasioning ulcers (loco citato p. 881), explicitly
mentions phlegmonous symptoms as κατὰ αἰδοῖον
(affecting the privates) and γυναικὶ κατὰ μήτραν ἢ
αἰδοῖον (in women affecting womb and privates),—loco
citato p. 893. Hence we think ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
justified in drawing attention to the passage as containing
an indication of the reason why ulcers of
the genital organs pursued a milder course and
admitted of an easier cure in Antiquity, because the
<i>ephemera</i> evidently facilitated the assimilation and
elimination of the contagion, this taking place either
at the point primarily attacked, or else occurring
because it (the ephemeral fever) led to an enhanced
activity of the cutaneous glands by provoking an
exanthematous eruption.</p>


<h3 id="S_39">§ 39.</h3>


<p>But for no small part of this reluctance on the
part of patients the Physicians were themselves to
blame. We have no wish in this place to enlarge
upon the possibility of professional indiscretion in
their case, though long ago the Hippocratic masters
saw themselves constrained to guard their scholars
against it.<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Of far greater weight was the nature
of the <i>treatment</i>, especially that applied to ulcers of
all kinds, which was excellently adapted to fill sufferers
with fear and trembling. Already <i>Hippocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> taught
that ulcers with callous margins must be cauterized
or else cut away with the knife. <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> declares
himself even more plainly in the same sense: “But
if the margins of the ulcer merely are discoloured
and callous, they must be removed right to where
the healthy flesh begins. Supposing this condition
to have extended more widely, then the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
arises,—whether we ought to cut away all the diseased
tissue, or prefer a more tedious method of cure. It
is natural and necessary in this case to consult the
inclination of the patient; for whereas some prefer
to avoid the knife and submit to a more tedious
treatment, others on the contrary are ready for
anything, so long as they get cured.” The same
procedure was adopted with ulcers of the genitals,
especially gangrenous ulcers, as is proved at once by
the passage already quoted on p. 176 of Vol. II above.</p>

<p>The Asiatic, for whom the genital organs were an
object of veneration, was no doubt horrified, as the
Turk is to this day,<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> at the idea of any such operation
on himself; while the licentious Roman, who
must have dreaded its very probable result in the
entire loss of the further use and enjoyment of the
parts in question,<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> sought any other means for
choice, preferred to have recourse to Priapus
or even resorted to suicide, like the <i>Municeps</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Pliny mentioned on p. 257, before he trusted himself
to the physicians who ever since the Carnifex (Butcher)
Archagathus had appeared at Rome, strove to rival
one another in infatuation for cautery and amputation.
In any case it was only the direst necessity<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> that
drove the sufferer under such circumstances to the
physician; while the latter had really and truly no
reason for enquiring into the origin of the evil, as
very often absolutely no alternative was left him but
to grasp the knife or cauterizing iron. In this way
medical procedure could not but have fallen into
disrepute, while physicians were in most instances
necessarily deprived of all opportunity of systematic
observation.</p>

<p>Whether there were other factors as well to induce
the old Physicians to apply the ordinary treatment
of ulcers in general to those of the genital organs,
we cannot indeed as yet for the time being determine.
Certainly the conjecture is an obvious one that they
may well have had an inkling of the specific nature
of such ulcers, and that it was not merely the local
mischief they sought to put a stop to by early application
of cautery and knife. However it is only
further and more careful investigations that must be
allowed to decide the point,—the more so, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
general <i>views as to the formation of ulcers</i> held by
the Ancients seem in many respects to tell against
it. Thus <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> says: “The mode in which these
(ulcers involving destruction of substance) are set up
however is twofold; they arise either by removal of
surrounding tissue (ἐκ περιαιρέσεως) or by eating
away (ἐξ ἀναβρώσεως). How the former acts is
well known. As to the eating away, if it proceed
from the inward parts of the organism, it is an
outcome of the evil humours; but if it arise from
outside, then it is a result of the physician’s remedial
measures or of fire.” From this we gather that all
ulcers of the genitals, as well as others, which did
not result from the action either of remedial measures
or of fire, were held as being necessarily an outcome
of the evil humours of the body. Further, that this
view was not in any way peculiar to the time of
Galen, but was a direct and necessary consequence
of the further development of the pathology of
“humours,” follows from the circumstance that we
find the same opinion expressed by <i>Hippocrates</i>.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>
Again <i>Plato</i> shared the latter author’s general doctrine
of <i>apostasis</i> (suppurative inflammation taking off evil
humours) in his “Timaeus”, where he derives from
the white phlegm, striking outwards to the skin,
cutaneous eruptions, rashes and the like maladies,
from the acrid, salty phlegm on the other hand the
fluxes of all types, bearing different names according
to the different parts of the body affected.</p>

<p>If we do not choose to infer from this the proof
of a then occurring, genuine and consistent genesis
of the affections peculiar to the genitals, we are
bound at any rate to admit that such a view must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
necessarily have debarred all thought of any <i>specific</i>
character as belonging to ulcers of these organs,—the
more so as to this very day we look in vain for
any clear conception of really characteristic symptoms
marking out Venereal ulcers in particular. Further,
the knowledge that ulcers of the genitals were contracted
through sexual intercourse, lacked entirely, so
far as the ancient Physicians were concerned, the
necessary confirmation and authority to induce them
to make a special and distinctive class of morbid
process to include them, because as a rule they paid
no sort of attention to the occasioning cause, unless
in virtue of its being still present and active, or else
by the necessity for its elimination, it could afford
some indication for therapeutic purposes. <i>Galen</i>
brings this out best and most clearly in the following
passage:<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> “Moreover it will be a fitting occasion
now to make it clear that not one of the causes
directly occasioning the diathesis, or particular condition
of body, will give any indication as to treatment;
guiding signs for the purpose must rather be
gathered from the complaint itself. What is to be
done in any individual case depends on the immediate
purpose and the nature of the part attacked, on the
predominant temperament and the like facts. For
to put it shortly, <i>in no case can an indication as to
what is beneficial be taken from any one of the factors
that are no longer existent</i>,—i.e. in actual operation.
But as it often happens that in order to diagnose
some affection that cannot be recognized either by
help of ratiocination or by the senses, we are obliged
to inquire into the cause that occasioned it, laymen
conclude the guiding signs for remedial treatment to
be taken from the same source. But this is by no
means so. This may be plainly seen in those instances
where the diathesis is quite well known in
all its details; for whether it be <i>ecchymosis or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
ulceration or erysipelas or putrescent ulcer</i> (σηπεδὼν) <i>or
phlegmonous affection in any organ, it is perfectly useless
to trace out the cause that occasioned it</i> (αἴτιον ποίησαν),
<i>if this latter is now no longer active</i>. On the other
hand for any affection, a clear insight into which is
lacking, a knowledge of the occasioning cause is
useful.”</p>

<p>This principle was equally applied to affections of
the genitals, the antecedent act of coition being
regarded as affording absolutely no help in diagnosis,
as we see from the passage of <i>Galen</i> to be next
discussed. In this passage the declaration of a
gonorrhœal patient to the effect that the women
with whom he had connection suffered no less than
himself from the malady, was entirely without influence
on our author in the way of inducing him to
assume and lay down a <i>specific</i> type of gonorrhœa.
Under these circumstances it is really a matter for
no surprise<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> that the old Physicians in discussing
affections of the genitals never allege sexual intercourse
as an occasioning factor amongst others; and
the conclusion drawn that such affections in Antiquity
were not contracted by coition, <i>because</i> the
ancient Writers do not definitely and in every single
instance assign this as a cause, evidences really and
truly merely the absence of any accurate study of
their works and the knowledge of their views that
is acquired as a result of such study. It is abundantly
clear however that the neglect of the etiological
factors referred to led eventually to their being
completely overlooked; and it is no less obvious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
that this must needs have been a source of manifold
mistakes, which degraded the physician in the eyes
of the non-professional laity, very often made him
ridiculous by reason of this ignorance, and brought
down, as we have seen, many a cut of the satirist’s
whip on his devoted shoulders. But how many of
our colleagues are there not at the present day
whom Venereal disease involves in the same doubts
and difficulties?</p>

<p>However it may perhaps be suggested that, although
the ancient Physicians did not feel themselves obliged
to make any mention of sexual intercourse as cause
of affections of the genitals, they cannot for all that
have failed to notice the phænomena of infection.
To say nothing of the fact that in no small proportion
of instances affections of the genitals under the
favouring conditions previously described did not as
a matter of fact arise through infection, but actually
in a sense spontaneously,<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> and further that to this
day we possess absolutely no criterion to distinguish
such diseases arising in this way,—for it is only
superficial and indolent observers that deny the
possibility of such origination altogether,—apart from
all this, the view which the Ancients took as a whole
of the general question of infection was one in the
highest degree inadequate. For this state of things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
as <i>Heyne</i><a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> long ago pointed out, the τὸ θεῖον (the
divine element), or in other words the prevalent
opinion that infectious diseases were an infliction of
the offended deity, is mainly responsible. In these
very diseases of the genitals, we have in fact seen
how they were ascribed to the wrath of Dionysus
and Priapus; and how long such ideas lasted, and
how intimately they were interwoven with the life
of the people, may be gauged by the circumstance
that even the Christian Fathers themselves took every
pains and used every effort to maintain them.</p>

<p>Now is it really in any way reasonable to expect
the physicians of those times to have so completely
extricated themselves from the predominant range
of ideas? and have we any right to abuse them for
their beliefs at the present moment, when in our
own day there are to be found not a few physicians
who deny absolutely the contagiousness of Venereal
disease under its different forms? All the old practitioners
could do was to draw attention to the fact
that underlying the τὸ θεῖον there lurked some
natural cause, and this view Hippocrates did actually
maintain in his writings. As to the indicative signs
of this cause perceptible by the senses, as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
material substance, whatever it may be, that communicates
infection, into all this they could hardly
be expected to initiate investigations,<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> deficient as they
were in every sort of aid and assistance for the task.
For I ask, have we, in spite of all our researches,
thus far attained to any satisfactory and certain
results? Could the Anti-Contagionists ever have
come forward at all, if we had been successful in
demonstrating the contagion to be perceptible to the
senses?</p>

<p>Besides all this, we actually find to the present
day that in the countries in question the contagion
exhibits but a low degree of virulence, and only
under epidemic influence, as at the epoch of
the Athenian Plague, did it assume a virulent
character at all,—a fact that will be made yet clearer
in our Continuation of the History of Venereal
Disease. But wherever the contagion did exhibit
this virulence of character, the ulcers that were set
up passed over as a rule into gangrenous mortification,
or else the physicians either exterminated it
altogether by the actual cautery or removed it along
with the part in which it had established itself. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
any further spread of the contagion in its original
form was not to be expected, as in patients of the
sort there can be no doubt all desire for coition
must have been destroyed.</p>

<p>If we now bring together the results of our discussion
so far, we shall find reason to believe that,
speaking generally, the ancient physicians,—that is
physicians properly so called,—possessed but scanty
opportunities, especially in the case of women,<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> of
observing with any precision the origin and course
of affections of the genital organs, for it was mostly
only the malignant forms of these that came under
their notice, and these were of their very nature,
except when epidemic conditions were at work,
necessarily of infrequent occurrence. Their pathological
views stood in the way of unprejudiced observation,
<i>conspicuous</i> characteristic symptoms were as
little to be found then as they are nowadays, any
adequate knowledge of the material <i>substrata</i> of
contagions was lacking to them in these as in other
forms of disease, and thus they felt no direct inducement
to class the <i>primary</i> affections of the genitals
as forming a special category of disease.</p>

<p>Then again with regard to the <i>secondary</i> symptoms,
the ancient practitioners in the cases treated by them
made the occurrence of such all but impossible, for
scalpel and cauterizing iron either entirely eradicated
the contagion along with its material <i>substratum</i>, or
else removed it with all speed before it could be
reabsorbed into the system. Even when these did
nevertheless appear, in some instances too great an
interval of time intervened, in others the parts
attacked were too remote from the spot primarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
affected for it to have been possible for them to be
referred to any direct inter-communication. Indeed
this was made an actual impossibility in most cases,
as it was just those very spots that are the usual
seat of the secondary affections which were attacked
primarily in consequence of the different modes of
<i>Venus illegitima</i> (abnormal love) with such extreme
frequency as to make it barely practicable for the
keenest eye at a diagnosis to discover any actual
distinction between the two,—and this without taking
into account the circumstance that in view of the
pronounced tendency conditioned by climatic causes
for the morbid process to strike outwards to the
external skin, mischief in the mucous membranes and
bones must necessarily have fallen to a considerable
extent into the background.</p>

<p>If circumstances put it out of the power of the ancient
Physicians to unite under one whole the separate
forms of Venereal disease, to look at the morbid
process in its entirety, it is no less self-evident that
for the same reasons they could have found no
occasion to invent a <i>special name</i> for a thing that
was simply invisible to them. Hence the conclusion
drawn that, because no such special name is found,
<i>therefore</i> Venereal disease cannot have existed, strictly
speaking requires no further consideration. Still,
granting for the sake of argument that they had
recognized at any rate the generic difference of the
primary affections, were they therefore bound to
introduce a special name for them? <i>Galen</i> shall
supply the answer. He says, mentioning<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> that the
old Physicians possessed no special name for depression
of the skull in conjunction with fissure of the
bone: “It is better to give a clear description than
to fall back miserably on barbarous names, which
the younger physicians have invented in great plenty.”
In another place<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> he finds fault with the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
designations given to ulcers, and then proceeds:
“If I consented to enumerate all the names, I
should be running the risk of deliberately teaching
what I recommend others to avoid, when I say that
the true searcher after truth must needs withdraw
his attention from the nomenclature that has grown
up, and fix his eyes on the actual fact.”</p>

<p>While these expressions of opinion demonstrate
the uselessness of the names, they show at the
same time that no inconsiderable number of such
names must no doubt have been in existence. So
far as affections of the genitals are concerned, not
only is this indicated by the Greek φθινὰς,—wasting
disease and the Latin <i>robigo</i>,—ulcerous
sore, not to mention the ambiguous ἄνθραξ,—carbuncle,
malignant pustule, but <i>Celsus</i> expressly
declares the fact, saying (Bk. VI ch. 18) at the
beginning of his description of Diseases of the sexual
parts: “Proxima sunt ea, quae ad partes obscoenas
pertinent, quarum apud Graecos vocabula et tolerabilius
se habent et accepta iam usu sunt, cum
omni fere medicorum volumine atque sermone
iactentur, apud nos foediora verba, ne consuetudine
quidem aliqua verecundius loquentium commendata
sunt.” (Next come such words as apply to the
parts of shame, the Greek names for which are at
once less offensive and are now sanctioned by usage,
as they are constantly occurring in every medical
book and medical discussion, whereas our native
(Latin) names are coarser and are not even recommended
by any custom on the part of those who
speak with some regard to modesty). Celsus himself
communicates but few of these words, for he wrote
<i>simul et pudorem et artis praecepta servans</i>, (observing
at once the laws of modesty and the rules of his
art); while between him and the writers of the Hippocratic
school medical Literature is all but a blank
to us. The same is the case between <i>Celsus</i> and
<i>Galen</i>; and of a period so important for our purpose
as that of the licentious Emperors, likewise not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
single independent medical Writer has come down
to us. In fact even the Fragments of the Compiler
Oribasius, lately made known to the world by Mai,
contain, alas! nothing more than the headings of
the Chapters most interesting to us.</p>

<p>In such a condition of things it is really verging
on the borders of folly to hope to give a dogmatic
and decisive judgement as to the knowledge of
Venereal disease possessed by the Physicians of Antiquity,—the
more so as the extant medical Works
have never once been adequately ransacked, as
<i>Naumann</i> only the other day proved in the case
of <i>Galen</i>. But of a surety it is easier to maintain
the Ancients knew nothing of Venereal disease, than
to devote the best part of a man’s life-time to the
investigation, how much the Ancients did actually
know about it!</p>


<h3 id="S_40">§ 40.</h3>


<p>If we turn now from these discussions to the
statements of the ancient Physicians themselves,
there are two different ways in which we may regard
them ourselves and present them to the reader’s eyes.
<i>Either</i> we put down consecutively everything that
has been said by one and the same Author and
examine each single datum we owe to him by itself,
<i>or</i> we bring together the data given by different
writers on one and the same subject, and then compare
these one with another. The first way, the one
generally followed by historians of Venereal disease
hitherto, gives us it is true the general results of the
knowledge possessed by the several writers on the
different forms of Venereal disease; but, seeing on
the one hand we do not in most instances actually
possess all the works of our Author, while on the
other even when we do, we are not justified in
looking upon his report as embodying a <i>résumé</i> of
all the knowledge of his time, the advantages of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
a way of dealing with the subject are on the whole
but slight, while it has the <i>dis</i>advantage of rendering
considerably more difficult the general survey of the
information possessed by Antiquity as to Venereal
disease, which nevertheless is really our immediate
and capital concern, and cannot fail moreover to
occasion a host of contradictions.</p>

<p>The second way not only relieves us from this
disadvantage, but also ensures us that general Survey
which is peculiarly necessary, and to the absence of
which the circumstance is chiefly to be ascribed that
it has been possible hitherto to convince the opponents
of the antiquity of Venereal disease only in
the most incomplete manner of its actual existence
in those times at all, as the exposition of the contrary
view, in itself incomplete, was bound in its
fragmentary presentment to seem even more incomplete
still. Of course, in following the second way
of exposition, there is an unavoidable dislocation of
the data communicated by each individual writer,
but this is a thing of but little moment, more particularly
as its inconvenience is minimised by our
giving the passages, when quoted for the first time,
<i>in extenso</i>, so as to have on subsequent occasions
merely to refer back to them. Again the want of a
clear marking of dates, a point undoubtedly of great
importance in historical researches, is readily obviated
by our laying down the available fixed points of our
chronology in the general Survey that forms a necessary
conclusion to our exposition.</p>

<p>No doubt <i>Hensler</i> and <i>Alex. Simon</i> had already
struck out this second way of exposition; but the
latter writer merely examined the data of the several
Writers by themselves without making any effort to
build them up into one whole. To do this was, it
is true, a proceeding quite foreign to the method
adopted by the Ancients, but for our own time,
accustomed as we now are to demand a systematic
exposition of a subject, it seems absolutely indispensible.
<i>Hensler</i> on the other hand in his treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of the question fixed his particular attention solely
on the Middle Ages, and made it his immediate aim
merely to prove that previously to the ninetieth year
of the XVth Century local affections of the genital
organs were already well known, and had been
subjected to treatment.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>Now with regard to the actual exposition that
follows, we shall refrain in it as much as possible
from going into particulars, such as the text itself
or the views of the Authors might seem to make
obligatory, as the needful space fails us, at any rate
for the present. Moreover the matter coming under
review has been discussed already by many others,
while as for critical elucidations, let them be as
pressingly required as they may, we lack all the
necessary <i>apparatus criticus</i>. In fact in the case of
several Writers, the translation, let alone the original
text, was with difficulty accessible, for which reason
many a passage of those already known may perhaps
have been passed by unregarded. A complete collection
of all passages, including those still unknown,—for
the harvest as was mentioned above has by no
means been all reaped,—will certainly not be demanded
by any reasonable reader from a Student of thirty,
for hardly even a greybeard Enquirer surely could
boast of having read all printed works of the ancient
Physicians. For the rest, our present object is not
at all to give an exhaustive exposition of all the
ideas and observations of ancient Physicians as to
affections of the genital organs; it only concerns us
here to bring together what is true and directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
available for our task. Under this head would
certainly seem to come the following seven points:</p>


<h3>1. <b>Gonorrhœa</b> (<i>Clap</i>).</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Nimia profusio seminis,—excessive flow of seed (Celsus),
γονόῤῥοια.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gonorrhœa, the name of which is compounded of
γονή (badly made semen) and ῥεῖν (to flow),<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
consists in an affection of the seminal vessels, not
of the private parts themselves, which merely serve
as the road for the excretion of the seed.<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> <i>Two
kinds</i> of gonorrhœa must be distinguished, according
as the malady is, or is not, combined with erection
of the penis.<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p><i>Gonorrhœa with erection of the penis</i> is called
sometimes <i>Satyriasis</i> or <i>Satyriasmus</i> sometimes <i>Priapism</i>,<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a>
and is a species of cramp,<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> which however
only attacks the penis, belongs to the category of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the emphysemata, or inflations,<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> and is conditioned
by an afflux of the humours, particularly of conspissated
or badly compounded humours.<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> However this last
phænomenon is only a symptom of that morbid
lasciviousness which <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> entitles Priapism,
while he designates the condition connected with it
by the name of Satyriasis, this having its origin in
an inflammatory affection of the seminal vessels.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
No proof is needed that both these views are right
so far as this, that gonorrhœa is both spasmodic
and inflammatory, and in either case may be accompanied
by priapism. Nothing, or only very little,
is evacuated of a nature to make the patients
experience relief; and if there is, they are again
attacked by the evil, until the original cause of the
erection is eliminated, on which the penis relaxes
of itself and subsides.<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> According to <i>Paulus Aegineta</i>
paresis of the spermatic vessels,—the second form
of gonorrhœa,<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a>—supervenes, if the disease is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
relieved, or else general spasms. Patients attacked
by such spasms succumb rapidly, suffering from cold
sweats and tympanitic distension of the abdomen.
<i>Alexander of Tralles</i> (IX. 10) saw the erection even
continue after the death of the patient. This form
is not a common one; it occurs pre-eminently among
young people,<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> and according to <i>Themison’s</i> observations,
who frequently saw the complaint in Crete,
where however it was probably very often a result
of pederastia, is subject to epidemic influence.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of this form of gonorrhœa demands
according to <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> (loco citato) immediate
general blood-letting,—this <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> also recommends,
and practised with advantage,—local cupping or
leeching, simple clysters, cooling and composing
embrocations and poultices of solanum (nightshade)
or cicuta (hemlock) in the lumbar region, of litharge,
Cimolian earth, psymithium (white-lead) with vinegar,
water or sweet wine, on the perineum. Internal
remedies are a decoction of mallows, mercury and
birch-bark, sap of rue, decoction from the root of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the iris, nymphaea (water-lily) and adianthum
(maidenhair). Diuretics are injurious. Patients should
at the same time be put upon a low, vegetable diet,
and the supine posture avoided. <i>Galen</i> (loco citato)
recommended in addition emetics, but not purgatives,
also embrocations of <i>ceratum rosaceum</i>, friction and
subsequently gymnastic exercises. <i>Alexander of Tralles</i>
insists particularly on the patient avoiding<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> all wanton
scenes and thoughts, and forbids the use of any cold,
specially astringent things, whereby the resolution of
the contraction is made more difficult (πάθος
δυσδιαφόρητον γενέσθαι,—the affection is rendered
hard to be resolved).</p>

<p>Gonorrhœa without erection of the penis, that is
to say gonorrhœa proper, exhibits a persistent, involuntary
discharge of the seed,<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> has some analogy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
with <i>incontinentia urinae</i>, and usually depends like
the latter on weakness or failure in the retentive
power of the spermatic vessels.<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Very often an
inflammatory stage supervenes, making the complaint
approximate to the first form; patients secrete
copious and hot semen, which provokes them to
ejaculation,—an ejaculation however that is followed
by great exhaustion. If they avoid copulation,
headache is established, pains in the stomach and
nausea, while nocturnal pollutions cause them similar
inconveniences to those they incur from coition. The
ejaculation is accompanied by heat and smarting
pain,—and this not solely among men but with women
as well; for one of these patients, <i>Galen</i> writes,<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
told me that not only himself, but also <i>the women
with whom he had accomplished coition</i>, experienced
during the discharge a biting, burning pain.
On the contrary, according to <i>Aretaeus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
seem the only symptoms found in conjunction
with the complaint are itching of the privates,
a voluptuous feeling and a violent inclination to
sexual intercourse. This datum admits of ready
explanation if we consider the fact that in southern
countries the inflammatory stage that makes its
appearance is very brief and as a rule hardly noticeable,
provided,—though no doubt this condition was
pretty often broken,—coition was not indulged in
during its course.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact in the great majority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
instances the Physician had only the chronic form
to treat. Generally speaking a patient first notices
the complaint, when the discharge begins; and then
the latter, when once the inflammatory stage is over,
proceeds day and night undisturbed and without
special voluptuous feeling, without wanton dreams,<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>
often without any particular sensation at all. The
actual discharge is a thin, cold, pale, sterile flux.
Towards the end of the illness it becomes thicker,
assumes an acrid quality, and eventually ceases
altogether to flow.<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> But if the malady persists,
especially in young people, then according to <i>Aretaeus</i>,
the whole visage of the sufferers assumes a greyish
look; they grow sluggish, atonic, spiritless, faint-hearted,
indolent, dull, weak, emaciated, incapable
of effort, unhealthy-looking,<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> pale, womanish, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
no appetite, feel chilly, complain of heaviness in the
limbs, are weak-loined, feeble and unfit for anything.
According to <i>Galen</i>, the abdomen falls in, besides
all the rest of the body collapsing more or less and
withering; while patients become lean, of a yellowish
pale complexion and hollow-eyed. In this way the
complaint not unfrequently paves the road to paralysis,
or else sufferers die of <i>tabes</i> or wasting.<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Specifically
and in itself the disease is not dangerous, but it
provokes various other complaints, and represents a
highly disagreeable, ill-reputed affection (Aretaeus),<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
that almost always follows a chronic course,<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>—for
which reason Aretaeus and Caelius Aurelianus
actually treat of it under the head of chronic
diseases.</p>

<p>Gonorrhœal pus is infectious, as is implied by the
Mosaic Laws of Purification (Leviticus Ch. XV.), and
the malady is communicated by coition, as is seen
from the words of <i>Galen</i>,—p. 428. But as early as
the Fourth Century the idea was prevalent that the
<i>conjunction of the stars</i> was not devoid of influence,
as such or such a conjunction might from a man’s
very birth determine that <i>the individual was to die
of gonorrhœa</i>. This at any rate is maintained by
<i>Julius Firmicus Maternus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> who lived in the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Constantine the Great. The disease has to be
carefully distinguished from the nocturnal pollutions,<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
that are at times one of the sequelae of gonorrhœa.</p>

<p>The treatment is, according to <i>Aretaeus</i>, at the
commencement that for an ordinary rheum or flux,
by keeping the parts affected cool, in order to
counteract the flow of the humours to them; by
degrees going on to a heating and at the same time
desiccating procedure, then the application of fresh
wool to the part, the employment of friction, embrocations
of <i>ceratum rosaceum</i> or <i>oinanthinum</i> with
white wine, olive oil with melilot, marjoram, rosemary,
poultices of barley-meal, saltpetre and dyll, but above
all rue, with the addition of honey or, according to
<i>Celsus</i>, vinegar; as further treatment, stimulating
cataplasms, of a strength to redden the skin or even
to bring out pustules on it, so as to draw off the
afflux of the humours, or else as an alternative,
plasters of the nature of the <i>emplastrum viride</i> (green
plaster), of <i>baccae lauri</i> (laurel berries). As for internal
treatment, the patient should drink decoctions of:
<i>semen lactucae</i> (lettuce juice), <i>cannabis</i> (hemp), <i>rad.
orcheos</i> (orchis root), <i>nymphaeae</i> (waterlily), <i>halicacabi</i>
(bladder-wort), etc.; and take <i>castoreum</i> (beaver oil),
or the antidotes of <i>Symphon</i>, <i>Philo</i>, or <i>Bestinus</i>,
which are prepared from <i>viper’s flesh</i>. In case of
very profuse discharge, the patient should be directed
to drink hard red wine; if he is acrid with bile
(χολωδέστερον καὶ δριμύτερον,—over-bilious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
acrid), lukewarm baths are brought into requisition
(Alexander of Tralles). On one point all authorities
are agreed, that the main thing to depend on is
diet. Both food and drink, says Celsus, must be
cold, a precaution Themison also recommended in
satyriasis, whereas Caelius Aurelianus denounces it.
The patient must not indulge in semen-forming
matters, such as cause flatulency, but take nourishing
food, flesh of animals but not fish, a little light wine
with it, for the constant ejaculation is weakening;
he should be careful as to resting,<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> lie on a cool
bed, either on the right side or the left (Paulus
Aegineta), not on the back (Celsus).</p>

<p>Where the complaint is of longer continuance,
exercise in the open air and the use of cold baths
is to be recommended, which latter <i>Celsus</i><a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> it appears
prefers to see resorted to, as well as cold aspersions,
almost at the very commencement; a mode of treatment
that is even now coming into fashion again
among ourselves, as the water-cure mania makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
further and further progress. <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> recommended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
besides diet and medicine, that with a view to retarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the preparation of semen, gymnastic exercises, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
such as bring the upper part of the body into
activity, e.g. ball-playing both with great and little
balls and the casting of leaden disks, be resorted to.
After bathing, patients must rub and wash over the
hips with desiccative ointments, oil expressed from
red, coarse olives, roses or quinces, wax-salves with
the juices of <i>sempervivum</i> (evergreen house-leek),
<i>solanum</i> (nightshade), <i>umbilicus Veneris</i> (navelwort),
<i>portulaca</i> (purslain), linseed boiled in water, etc.
I once saw, he says, the Intendant of a Gymnasium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
Athletes lay a leaden disk on the lumbar region of
an athlete as a measure against nocturnal pollution,—a
means <i>Caelius Aurelianus</i> prescribed <i>also</i> for
gonorrhœal patients,—and afterwards recommended
the same treatment to another sufferer from these,
who was thankful for the advice. Others again found
lying on the <i>agnus castus</i> beneficial to them, as well
as the taking of its juice along with rue. Violently
active refrigerants in the form of ointments, prepared
from poppy and <i>atropa mandragora</i> should not be
employed, and this equally applies to sleeping on
these plants when they are in bloom, for they act
injuriously on the kidneys. On the other hand sleeping
on roses was advantageous,—Caelius Aurelianus added
to the list the leaves and flowers of <i>vitex</i> (agnus
castus, Abraham’s balm).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> “Besides these I have
excogitated many other specifics for patients of the
sort, and found their utility confirmed in practice.
For instance those afflicted with such a condition of
body should pay particular attention to this. When
the accumulation of semen that has to be ejaculated
is at its greatest, they should during the day take
a nourishing yet moderate meal, and then when they
lie down to sleep accomplish sexual intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
But on the following day, after taking their fill of
sleep, they should on rising chafe themselves till the
skin is reddened. Next they should rub the body
all over with oil; then soon after take some well-leavened,
pure bread, baked in the baking-pan, and
mixed with wine, after which they may then go
about their customary business. Between the rubbing
with oil and the meal of bread patients may go for
a walk, if there is a spot convenient for the purpose
in the neighbourhood, <i>except in the colder time of
the year, for at that season it is better for them to stay
indoors</i>.”</p>

<p>With regard to <i>gonorrhœa in women</i>, it is all but
impossible to arrive at any accurate knowledge of
what the Ancient Physicians knew concerning it.
The reason of this is that the views held as to the
effect of deteriorated menstrual blood and of the
ῥοῦς γυναικεῖος (female discharge), by means of
which the whole body was supposed to purge itself
of evil humours,<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> absolutely precluded the possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
of any unprejudiced observation, in precisely the
same way as down to quite modern times the <i>fluor albus</i>
(white flux, blennorrhœa) conditioned the extremely
imperfect knowledge possessed by the faculty of
female gonorrhœa. We purpose to leave over the
inquiry into the points which differentiate the two
(male and female gonorrhœa) to another opportunity;
and will only note here that gonorrhœa in women,
strictly so called, was by no means utterly unknown,—in
fact there is no doubt whatever as to its being
distinguished from the ῥοῦς γυναικεῖος (female
discharge), as is shown by the passage of
<i>Galen</i> quoted above, and still more clearly by
<i>Aretaeus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> who speaks of γονόῤῥοια γυναικεῖ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>α
(female gonorrhœa) distinctly as ἄλλος ῥόος λευκὸς,
another species of white flux. Whether perhaps this
knowledge was first accumulated at the epoch of
Tiberius and his fellows cannot indeed be positively
determined; but certainly the word ἐλέξαμεν (we
have named it) of the text of Aretaeus may very
well leave room for such a conjecture, and as a matter
of fact Aretaeus would appear to have lived under
Domitian, and was therefore a contemporary of
Martial’s!</p>


<h3>2. Ulcers and Caruncles in the Urethra.</h3>

<p>We have already seen from Hippocrates, Celsus
and Galen that the ancient Physicians had observed
the inflammation and subsequent matteration of
the small mucous glands of the urethra evidenced
by the symptoms of painful micturition, and seeing
that mere tenesmus, as well as dysentery, are
denominated ἑλκώσις (ulceration) by them, it is by
no means improbable that many a urethral ulcer and
many a case of gonorrhœa may have been treated
under the name of ischuria (retention of urine). This
is the more likely, as we learn from a passage of
<i>Celsus</i><a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>, one usually misinterpreted in several respects,
that the urethral discharge was explained as due to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
an extension of the ulcer to the spermatic cords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
(<i>vasa deferentia</i>,—seed-bringing vessels). Yet further
confirmation is afforded by a passage of <i>Actuarius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
already cited by Simon, and our own conjecture
expressed on a previous page thus justified.</p>

<p>Ulcers however also occurred in the urethra<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
unconnected with tubercular swellings (ἀφανὲς ἕλκος,—invisible
ulcer); these not unfrequently occasioned
bleeding,<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> and made their presence known by
the accompanying pain, while synchronously small
irregularly-shaped particles (ἐφελκύδες) were ejected.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>
The appropriate treatment of these ulcers has been
described by <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> (loco citato); it consisted
in injections of honey and milk (<i>Aëtius</i>, IV.
2. 19., and <i>Actuarius</i> also recommended <i>enemata
morsus expertia</i>,—clysters free from biting acridity),
introduction of lotus pounded in a leaden mortar by
means of a feather or a twisted piece of lint (λεπτὸν
στρεπτὸν,—light material twisted,—an anticipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
of the bougie?) along with a mixture of gall-apple,
flowers of zinc (oxide of zinc), starch-flour and aloes
smeared in equal parts with rose-sap and plantain-sap.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently such ulcers give rise to the
establishment of <i>caruncles in the urethra</i>, particularly
<i>in the neighbourhood of the neck of the bladder</i>, though
they occur<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> also in the ear, nose, as well as in
connection with the privates and anus, in the latter
case presenting the symptoms of ischuria (retention
of urine), interfering as they do with the outflow of
the urine. The presence of these caruncles may be
diagnosed by the preceding symptoms, as also by
the circumstance that the urine is evacuated by the
introduction of a <i>catheter</i>, that this occasions pain
at the seat of ulceration and breaks through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
caruncle, causing the urine to pass mixed with blood
and the remains of the caruncle. It is necessary
to know if a thrombus (blood-clot) or calculus blocks
the urethra; but as to whether we pronounce the
mischief to be situated in the urethra itself and the
cause of the ischuria to be there as well, this is a
distinction of no practical or scientific value.<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
as a rule it was solely as being the excretory duct
of the bladder that the urethra had some little
attention directed to it; while any signs it exhibited
were generally regarded simply as symptoms connected
with the urinary bladder and the kidneys.
Partial <i>growing up, or morbid extuberance, in the
urethra</i> (συσσάρκωσις,—a growing together) following
on a previous ulceration is described by <i>Heliodorus</i>,
as given in Oribasius,<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> occasioning either a narrowing
of the urethral passage in one spot or its being
filled up over its entire superficies with morbid
outgrowths of tissue. Partial narrowing causes dysuria
or strangury (difficulty of micturition), the narrowing
of the whole canal by morbid outgrowths, ischuria
(impossibility of micturition, retention of urine). The
outgrowth must be removed by means of a small
lancet. The mode of procedure is then as follows.
The patient is placed on his back, the penis straight
out; then with the fingers of the left hand the
operator compresses it behind the spot where the
growth is found, in order to prevent the blood from
flowing inwards when the incision is made; next he
takes the knife in the right hand, pushes the point
into the urethra, divides it as far along as the base
of the morbid growth, but not so as to go beyond
it. This done, he proceeds to cut out the growth
by means of a circular incision, and compresses the
urethra between the fingers, causing the growth to
spring forwards. Supposing it now projects but does
not actually spring out, it is extracted by means of
a <i>mydion</i> (boat-shaped instrument). After the removal
of the growth the urethra must be protected from
contact with the urine, which during the first few
days is best done by applying an <i>ipoterion</i>, or
compress,<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> made of papyrus. The mode of preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
this is described in detail later on, and a sort of
elastic catheter indicated. Catheters of copper and
tin might also be used, or a quill taken for the
purpose. The tin or lead catheters are not to be
inserted till after the third day, and carry in front
a projecting shield. The application of a bandage
described is declared to be of great advantage.
Scirrhosities of <i>the neck of the bladder</i>, abscesses and
the like, are mentioned by <i>Galen</i> (loco citato) as
occurring occasionally. With regard to <i>diseases of the
prostates</i> subsequent investigations must authenticate
the amount of knowledge possessed of these by the
physicians of Antiquity.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the testicles</i><a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> is usually characterized
according to <i>Paulus Aegineta</i><a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> by pain under strong
pressure by the fingers, while only a slight pressure
causes no uneasiness. Redness and heat are slight
externally, but the latter is perceptible deep in by
an investigating finger. Sometimes fever is associated
with it, and if the inflammation is not quickly combated,
the pain, <i>Celsus</i> tells us,<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> extends to the
inguinal and lumbar regions, the parts swell, the
spermatic cord grows thicker and at the same time
indurated. Both authorities make the treatment
consist at first in blood-letting at the ankle,<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> and
the use of soft poultices of bean-meal,<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> pounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
cumin, linseed, etc. to which in cases of induration
is added later on a mixture of crocus and wine. In
obstinate instances poultices are used of <i>rad. cucumeris
agrestis</i> (root of the wild cucumber);<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> <i>Paulus Aegineta</i>
under these circumstances prescribes grapes, peas,
cumin, brimstone, nitre and resin, made into a
cataplasm with honey, besides sundry wax-salves.
A considerable list of remedial agents is found
enumerated in <i>Marcellus</i> (ch. 33.) intended to combat
the <i>tumores et dolores testiculorum</i> (swellings and pains
in the testicles); of these we will only mention the
salves of mutton-suet and nitre, the sea-water compresses,
the poultices of <i>rad. cicutae</i> (hemlock root),
white of egg, frankincense and ceruse (white lead).
<i>Aretaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> gives us an interesting piece of information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
to the effect that in order to counteract neuralgia of
the testicles and spermatic cord, accompanied at the
same time by intestinal colic, the spermatic cord was
<i>cut out</i>, being looked upon as the cause of the
suffering. Important too is the case related by
<i>Hippocrates</i>,<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> where a patient at Athens suffered
from <i>prurigo</i> (itch) of the whole body, but above all
of the <i>testicles</i> and the forehead, his skin having
grown thick and hard as it does in leprosy, so that
nowhere could it be pulled up above the general
surface.</p>

<p><i>Induration</i> of the testicles is mentioned by <i>Galen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>
who assigns it as one cause of sterility. The same
author<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> likewise speaks of the testicles being affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
with <i>aphthae</i> (διδύμους ἀφθῶντας), which he says
should be treated with <i>terra cimolia</i> (Cimolian chalk)
and myrtle-berries.</p>

<p>φθινάς, ἄνθραξ, ἔσχαρα,—robigo, cancer. (Wasting ulcer,
malignant pustule, scab,—ulcerous sore, eating, suppurating
ulcer).</p></blockquote>

<p>Though we cannot exactly subscribe to Alexander
Simon’s declaration to the effect that it would fill
whole volumes, if we wished to cite systematically
and in full all that has been said by the oldest and
earlier medical Writers on ulcerous affections that
attack the sexual parts from the points of view of
pathology and therapeutics, still the number of such
passages is no doubt sufficiently imposing. Unfortunately
their contents cannot be described as equally
important; for the pathological side is sacrificed to
the therapeutic,—in fact the great majority give
nothing more than the general names ἕλκος (ulcer)
or φλεγμονὴ αἰδοίου (inflamed tumour of the
privates), and then at once pass on to discuss the
remedial measures expedient. This mode of procedure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
is indeed quite consistent with the general character
of medical science in those days, for it is always
the case that the more medicine declines, the more
practitioners think themselves bound to look for
remedial means nowhere but in the prescription-books.
Curiously enough we find that almost every thing
given by the later physicians already has a place in
the pages of <i>Celsus</i>; the latter probably utilized the
Alexandrian physicians, on whose knowledge the later
Writers appear to have made little advance.</p>

<p>Now with regard to ulcers of the genitals in
general,—these are of frequent occurrence, as to begin
with the parts are from their very constitution prone
to putrefactive changes, as well owing to their moist
nature, possessing as they do so many glands that
draw moisture together, and being covered with hair,
as because they are at the same time excretory
organs<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>. The time of year exerts an influence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
the appearance of such ulcers, for they show themselves
chiefly in the summer,<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> particularly when a
South wind is blowing,<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> a wind that is moist and
warm and fosters a tendency towards the resolution
of fluid and solid parts alike. Thus ulcers of the
genitals are likewise subject to epidemic influence,
as has been clearly demonstrated on previous pages.
They are acquired by coition, and that equally by
natural coition, as the instance of Hero mentioned on
a previous page shows without a shadow of doubt, as
by the unnatural forms, and particularly by paederastia,
which last caused the malady of Naevolus’slave also
referred to in an earlier passage. Moreover in the hot
regions of Asia and Africa want of cleanliness also,
especially when men were uncircumcised, gave occasion,
as in Apion’s case, to the establishment of ulcers of
the genitals. These were looked upon by the Ancient
physicians in most instances as an outcome of the evil
humours of the body,—an opinion which need cause us
less surprise as even in much more modern times a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
number of physicians have endeavoured to explain
the origin of chancres by an antecedent general
infection, that manifested itself in this way, viz. by
the appearance of these sores. Ulcers not unfrequently
took the form of aphthae, particularly in women,<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
being in that case more superficial, but for that very
reason readily eating their way over adjacent parts,—(<i>cancer</i>,
eating ulcer). In many instances inflammation
(φλεγμονὴ, ἐρυσίπελας—phlegmonous inflammation,
erysipelas) and swelling of the parts affected were
accompanying circumstances. They were often painful,—sometimes
moist, sometimes dry. In the majority
of cases they assumed under favouring conditions a
putrefactive character (φαγέδαινα,—phagedenic or
eating ulcer), under which circumstances worms
actually bred in the sores, or else they manifested
from the very first a marked tendency
to pass over into gangrene (ἄνθραξ, <i>carbunculus</i>,—malignant
pustule, carbuncle), where as a rule merely
an ulcer developing from a minute bladder (bleb) or
φύμα existed in the first instance. On the other
hand its course was often very chronic, without
phlegmonous ulcers at all, or if these were present,
either they were callous, or else condylomatous
outgrowths sprung from them.</p>

<p>In accordance with these varying factors did the
<i>treatment of ulcers of the genitals</i> vary, though without
any universally recognized special distinction from
that adopted for ulcers in general. Speaking generally,
purgings by the rectum are not indicated; but
preferably in affections of the genitals revulsory
treatment by emetics is employed.<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> If blood-letting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
is resorted to, it must be either in the hollow of
the knee or at the ankle.<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> As to local measures,
fatty matters according to <i>Antyllus</i> are not good for
the genitals,<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> whereas astringents and desiccatives
are beneficial, if that is to say the phlegmonous
condition is absent.<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> On the contrary if the latter is
found, this must in the first place be combated, then a
mixture applied consisting of sifted resin and pounded
cumin, or alternatively a poultice of barley-meal,
hydromel and vine-leaves reduced to a pulp, or else
cumin with butter and tree-resin.<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> Above all Galen<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
recommended in the early stages before the appearance
of an eating or phagedenic ulcer (κατὰ τῶν ἐν
αἰδοίοις φλεγμονῶν ἐν ἀρχῇ, πρὶν ὑποφαίνεσθαι
τινα νομώδη σηπέδονα,—in phlegmonous affections
of the privates at the commencement, before
any eating ulceration appear) a <i>ceratum rosaceum</i>
(wax-salve of roses), the preparation of which he
gives <i>in extenso</i>, and Aëtius copying from him; its
activity is enhanced by the addition of a little <i>oleum
sabinum</i> (Sabine oil). If the ulcers are complicated
with <i>swelling</i>, a compound of white-lead (ψιμύθιον)
and triturated vine-leaves is applied,<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> sea-water
compresses,<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> or poultices of boiled lentils and
pomegranate rind.<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> For <i>painful</i> ulcers pompholyx
(flowers of zinc)<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> was particularly recommended, or
a decoction of linseed with the addition of myrrh;
also woman’s milk may be advantageously used as
well,<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> especially with the addition of <i>anodynes</i>, and
above all pompholyx or flowers of zinc. <i>Paulus
Aegineta</i> (loco citato) prescribed the application
of butter and resin melted together in equal
parts, or linseed ground up with myrrh and resin.
In <i>raw</i> and <i>dry</i> ulcers of the genitals the aloe was
very generally prescribed; it was powdered and
sprinkled over the sore,<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> or if a phlegmonous condition
was already established, dissolved in water.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
In the second case <i>Oribasius</i><a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> prescribed likewise
the use of lead,—and indeed it was a usual recommendation
with regard to most of the recognized
remedies that they should be pounded and triturated
in leaden mortars with leaden pestles.</p>

<p>Superficial ulcers <i>of an aphthae-like character</i> were
treated as early as in <i>Hippocrates’</i> time and indeed
by him<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> with a decoction of myrtle-berries boiled
in wine. As a remedy against <i>moist</i> ulcers a certain
mixture of Crito’s, compounded of frankincense and
myrrh boiled in sweet wine, had a great reputation;<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>
but above all the powder of <i>charta usta</i> (papyrus
ash), anise and <i>cucurbita</i> (gourd)<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> was employed,
after the ulcer had been washed with urine; further
the <i>cortex pinus</i> (cork-tree), <i>lapis haematites</i> (bloodstone,
haematite iron-ore),<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> to which frankincense
was added in the case of more deep-seated ulcers,<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
also <i>cadmium ustum</i> (burnt calamine) (Paulus Aegineta);
likewise washing with urine proved beneficial.<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> In
<i>spreading or eating</i> ulcers (νομῶδες ἕλκος) a poultice
was applied of lentils, pomegranates and oxymel<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
reduced to a pulp; but a still more usual remedy
was to sprinkle verdigris over the sore,<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> and especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
verdigris in conjunction with a salve made of <i>charta
usta</i> (papyrus ash), sulphur, lead-slag, honey and
<i>ceratum rosaceum</i> (wax-salve of roses); another remedy
highly thought of was the <i>pastillus corax</i> (corax cake),
the ingredients of which were verdigris, chalk, gallnut,
frankincense, turpentine, wax, oil of myrtles and
beef-tallow; this was particularly beneficial in combating
the carbunculous form of the disease. Very
often however recourse to the cauterizing iron and
the knife was unavoidable, especially if gangrene
supervened, or if the callosity of the edges of the
ulcer made cicatrisation impossible.</p>

<p>Such were the general methods of treatment
employed for ulcers of the genital organs, but these
naturally varied according to the various distinctions
between the several sorts conditional on the situation
of the sore. Thus it becomes our next business to
indicate on what parts of the body ulcers were
observed:—</p>


<p>A. <span class="smcap">Ulcers on the male Genital Organs.</span></p>

<p>It is invariably the case that forms of ulceration
affecting the male genitals are the most familiar and
best known, and this was equally true in Antiquity.
Whatever information the Ancient physicians deemed
it necessary to record on the subject is found as
early as <i>Celsus</i> laid down with something approaching
to completeness in his writings (VI. 18.).</p>


<p>a. <i>Ulcers of the Prepuce.</i></p>

<p>According to Leonidas<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> fissures and cracks in the
prepuce frequently occurred, in all cases of the latter
being too tight and being forcibly drawn back. On
these supervened pain and phlegmonous inflammation;
and then if a cure were not speedily effected, the
edges assumed a condition of callosity, necessitating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the use of the knife for its removal. However, more
often than not the wound broke out again, because
as was noted as early as by <i>Hippocrates</i>,<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> wounds
of the prepuce are as a rule obstinate in healing.
To meet this eventuality <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> provides an entirely
suitable procedure. While ulcers of the glans penis
demand desiccative remedies, those of the prepuce
rather call for <i>epilotics</i>,<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> especially anise. Supposing
the prepuce to become gangrenous, it must be
cut away circularly, and the bleeding stopped by
cauterization; if this treatment is not needful, a
mixture of verdigris with honey, or pomegranate and
vetch is applied.<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> Ulcers on the inner fold of the
prepuce, as also on the skin of the penis generally,
are mentioned by <i>Celsus</i> (VI. 18.), the latter likewise
by <i>Galen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Such ulcers on the inner fold of the
prepuce, Celsus states, not unfrequently give occasion
to the setting up of phimosis and paraphimosis; and
yet another consequence, a morbid growing together
of glans and prepuce was observed by <i>Oribasius</i>
(loco citato, 5.) and <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> (VI. 56.), for
which these authors prescribe appropriate medical
and surgical treatment. Under the name of <i>cancer</i>
(eating ulcer) of the prepuce Celsus, it would seem,
describes the νομὴ (spreading ulcer) of the Greek
physicians, which commences by the ulcer turning
black. Occasionally too the ulcers developed out of
themselves morbid growths, excrescences or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
condylomata, particularly the form known as <i>thymion</i>
(warty excrescence).</p>


<p>b. <i>Ulcers of the Glans Penis.</i></p>

<p>These are, as pointed out by <i>Celsus</i> (VI. 18.), best
described by taking their pathological and therapeutic
aspects together; but it would serve no useful purpose
to quote once more in this place the passages dealing
with this part of the subject, which have been so
often printed already. He makes a distinction, as
does <i>Galen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> between dry and clean, moist and
suppurative, ulcers, the latter of which readily lead
to phimosis and paraphimosis. The discharge is
sometimes thin and watery, sometimes purulent, and
on occasion becomes evil-smelling; the ulcerations
both spread superficially and penetrate inwards, and
may actually destroy the glans underneath the
prepuce, so that it perishes altogether. When this
happens, <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> (VI. 57.) has a leaden
pipette inserted in the orifice of the urethra, to enable
the patient to pass water. In other cases the prepuce
grows into one with the ulcerated glans penis (<i>Celsus</i>,
<i>Paulus Aegineta</i>, <i>Oribasius</i>). Ulcers <i>circa coronam
glandis</i> (round the crown of the glans penis) are
mentioned by <i>Aëtius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>A special kind is the <i>cancer colis</i> (eating ulcer of the
member), probably the same as the νομὴ (spreading
ulcer) of the Greeks, which Aëtius<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> delineates as a
spreading, flaccid ulcer, which on pressure emits a
thin bloody discharge, that subsequently becomes
feculent. Hemorrhage is apt to supervene according
to Celsus on the shedding of a cicatrix artificially
produced by operation or the cauterizing iron.
Another species of <i>cancer</i> is the φαγέδαιν<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>α
(phagedenic, eating ulcer) of the Greeks, which extends
rapidly and penetrates to the bladder. It appears
to be identical with ἄνθραξ (malignant pustule),
though Celsus mentions the <i>carbunculus colis</i> (carbuncle
of the member) in a special category; for the description
he gives, bk. V. ch. 28., of carbuncle is
equally applicable to the phagedaena.<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> Ἄνθραξ
(malignant pustule) begins with itching, later on a
pustule, or else a number of little bladders or blebs
resembling millet-seeds appear, which burst in much
the same way as a blister due to burning does,
leaving behind an <i>ulcus crustaceum</i> (scab-encrusted
ulcer), resembling the cicatrix of a burn; this is
firmly adherent and black in colour. The surrounding
tissue is likewise black and violently inflamed, the
inflammation not unfrequently having an erysipelas-like
character. <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> designates the process ἀνθράκωσις,
and declares that buboes are an accompanying
feature. He holds the ulcers of the genitals
occurring under the special climatic conditions laid
down by Hippocrates above to have been partly
ἄνθραξ,<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> the disease to which Hero succumbed.</p>

<p>Another kind of ulcer affecting the male genitals
is mentioned by <i>Pollux</i><a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> under the name of θηρίωμα
(malignant sore), which <i>Celsus</i> (V. 28.) likewise speaks
of, but without particularizing its situation. The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
fact applies to ulcers of the glans penis as to those
of the prepuce, viz. that many forms of morbid
outgrowths arise from them; in other instances
callosities on the edges of the ulcers are built up,
leaving behind a callous protuberance, which the
Greeks appear to have called ἥλος (a nail), the
Romans <i>clavus</i> (a nail).<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> The proper treatment to
be followed in each of these special cases is given
by Celsus and the Writers he cites.</p>


<p>B. <span class="smcap">Ulcers of the Female Genital Organs.</span></p>

<p>In this connection, as indeed in the discussion of
the female genital organs generally, we once again
meet with the difficulty due to the indefiniteness of
the names given to the several parts. Not only do
the Greeks constantly make use of the general
expression αἰδοία, μόρια (privates, parts), but they
likewise employ ὑστέρον and μήτρα (the womb)
sometimes as meaning the vagina, sometimes the
uterus, though it is true the later Writers like <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
designate the vagina ἡ ὑστέρα, the uterus ὁ ὑστέρος,
yet without keeping consistently to the distinction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
The same applies to the use in Latin of <i>locus</i> (place),
<i>pars</i> (part), and <i>vulva</i> (womb), which last word stands
for the uterus in <i>Celsus</i>, <i>Pliny</i> and most of the later
Writers.</p>

<p>Passing over the indefinite expressions <i>dolores</i>
(pains), <i>inflammatio</i> or <i>phlegmoné</i> (inflammation) of
the genitals, although the treatment prescribed for
them clearly implies that very often ulceration was
concurrently present, we find the various kinds of
ulcers of the female genitals most fully and systematically
described by <i>Aretaeus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> <i>Paulus Aegineta</i>
(III. 65-68.) and <i>Aëtius</i><a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> following Archigenes,
Soranus and Aspasia.<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a><a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p><i>Abscesses Aëtius</i> says (loco citato, ch. 110.) occur
on the female <i>labia</i>; if these extend in the direction
of the anus, they must not be opened with the knife,
as fistulas are liable to be set up, but there is no
fear of this when they extend towards the urethra.
The same author (p. 109.) speaks of <i>pustulae scabrae</i>
(scabrous, scurfy pustules) in the vagina and orifice
of the womb, which throw off bran-like scales, as
also (ch. 108.) of <i>tubercula miliaria</i> (miliary tubercles)
in the same localities. These may no doubt be
recognized by touch, but are better diagnosed by
means of the uterine speculum, or <i>Dioptra</i>, and <i>ex
coitus affrictu</i> (in consequence of friction in coition)
interfere with menstruation and conception. Obviously
what is here pointed to is the swollen mucous glands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
which in our modern practice likewise are frequently
observed in gonorrhœal cases. Often the ulcers take
a form characterized by <i>fissures</i> (ῥαγάδες, <i>fissurae</i>,—fissures,
<i>rimae</i>,—cracks), particularly at the orifice
of the uterus.<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> Sometimes they become callous, at
others give rise to morbid outgrowths; as a rule the
discharge is a thin watery juice, and pain is felt
during coition.<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>Ulcers strictly so called, says Aretaeus, are either
superficial, in fact rather excoriations than ulcers,
and far-spreading; they itch as though salt had been
sprinkled on the surface, give off a small quantity
of thick pus, free from smell, and are not malignant.
To this class probably belong the aphthae-like ulcers
of Hippocrates.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> In other cases they are more
deep-seated; being then painful, discharging an evil-smelling
pus, and having a less mild character than
the former, but still not such as to be described as
malignant. If they penetrate yet deeper, the edges
then become rough, the discharge takes the form of
a malodorous juice, while the pain is more severe
than in the other kinds. The actual tissue of the
womb is partially destroyed in the latter case, while
morbid outgrowths form, which make cicatrization
extremely difficult. This last kind was known also
as <i>phagedaena</i>, (eating ulcer); it is dangerous, especially
if the pain increases and the patient falls into
low spirits. An offensive juice is discharged, so foul
that the patient herself is hard put to bear it; the
ulcer is highly intolerant of being touched for the
application of remedial means; it may end fatally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
and is known under the name of “Crab-ulcer”.
Νομὴ (spreading ulcer),<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> carbuncle and <i>sordida
ulcera</i> (foul ulcers) of the uterus are mentioned by
<i>Aëtius</i> (loco citato), who shows the mode of investigating
them by means of the uterine speculum and
a treatment consisting mainly of injections<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> and
pessaries prepared of a number of different remedies.
Not unfrequently unskilful treatment of ulcers of the
vagina occasioned morbid outgrowths, which according
to <i>Celsus’</i> teaching,<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> must be removed by surgical
means. Lastly the fact that ulcers of the genital
organs of women were prejudicial to men who
consummated coition with them and were for that
reason dreaded by them, is clearly implied in the
narrative of <i>Cedrenus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>


<h3>4. Ulcers of the Fundament.</h3>

<p>We have already seen how fissures and ulcers
of the fundament were a not unusual consequence
of the vice of the pathic, yet not the faintest
indication of the fact is to be found in the medical
Writers. The knowledge possessed by the Ancients
as to affections of the fundament have been collected
with a very considerable degree of completeness by
<i>Aëtius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> especially as copying Galen; the remaining
authorities treat them as a rule in conjunction with
the corresponding affections of the genitals, and
mostly recommend the same remedies for them. So
far therefore as they are concerned we refer back
to the information given in connection with the latter.
At the same time the remark may be permitted that this
juxtaposition of the two seems to point to the Ancients
having held, as we maintain they did, the view that
affections of the genitals and affections of the anus
arose from like causes and were of like character,
as is shown by their dealing with the one and the

<p><i>Ardentes dolores</i> (burning pains)<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> and <i>pruritus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
(itching)<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> of the anus are not uncommon. <i>Inflammations</i><a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>
often supervene as a consequence of fissures,
morbid growths and ulcers. <i>Rhagades</i> (cracks) and
<i>fissures</i><a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> are found either in the sphincter muscle
or in the rectum, and are an accompaniment of
condylomata, whenever the latter become inflamed
and spread, causing the surrounding tissue to rupture;
the edges frequently assume a callous condition, and
then require to be broken down and thus transformed
into a simple ulcer. Often abscesses are set up<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>
as a result of the inflammation, and these are liable
to lead to fistulas. The ulcers<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> on occasion assume
the character of the νομὴ φαγέδαινα (eating and
spreading ulcer). Supposing them situated on the
sphincter ani, they must neither be cut nor cauterized,
as severance of the muscle makes it impossible for
the patient to retain the faeces. This loss of retentive
power may also occur apart from any operation, if
the νομη (spreading ulcer) destroy the muscle.
Supposing on the contrary the νομὴ to be below the
sphincter, knife or cauterizing iron may either of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
them be employed. In some instances ulcers lead
to a morbid growth at the orificium ani, that must
be obviated by means of pipettes of lead.<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> In other

<h3>5. Buboes.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Bubo, panus (swelling resembling the thread wound on
bobbin of a shuttle), paniculus (diminutive of same), inguen
(swelling in the groin).</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the name of <i>bubo</i> the ancient Physicians
understood any form of inflammation of the lymphatic
glands. Now such inflammation occurs above all other
places in the inguinal region, and thus inflammation
of the inguinal glands came to be especially indicated
by the word, as well as the inguinal region itself.
Similarly the Romans used <i>inguen</i> (the groin) both for
the region and for the disease. Subsequently many
distinctions were drawn; a phlegmonous affection
combined with swelling was called a βουβὼν (bubo),
while the name φῦμα (swelling) was appropriated
to a swelling of the glands characterized by its rapid
establishment and its tendency to suppuration (bubo
with suppurative pustule in the centre), and φύγεθλον
(burning swelling) to one conjoined with (cutaneous)
inflammation of an erysipelas character,<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> which last
form, if it passes on into induration, is known as
χοιρὰς or <i>struma</i> (scrofulous or strumous swelling).
The best exposition from the points of view equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
of pathology and therapeutics is found in <i>Galen</i>.<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a>
The glands in virtue of their spongy structure are
peculiarly liable to take up rheums or fluxes of all
descriptions; accordingly the glands of the groin,
armpits and neck swell, directly ulcers are set up in
the toes, fingers or head. The body being overloaded
with evil humours is another reason for the
establishment of buboes, and in this case they are
more difficult to cure. Further, <i>Hippocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> derived
buboes in women from interrupted menstruation, and
maintains<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> that the most part owe their origin to
some affection of the liver.</p>

<p>The majority of Writers however are agreed that
among other occasioning causes ulcers hold the first
place,<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> though none of them speak expressly of
ulcers of the genitals, unless indeed we see good to
make the passage of Hippocrates discussed a little
above refer to these. No doubt in this passage
the words ἑλκώματα, φύματα ἔξωθεν ἔσωθεν τὰ
περὶ βουβῶνας (ulcerations, tumours external and
internal in the inguinal region) might admit of such
an explanation, in which case the words must be
taken not as referring to each single patient, but
rather held to mean that ulcers and glandular swellings
with a tendency to suppuration were set up, the
latter occurring in some patients in the urethra, in
others in the groin. Such an interpretation is favoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
by the case of the Eunuch discussed in § 20, for
there can be no doubt the metathesis of buboes into
fistulous ulcers was noted by Celsus and other
observers. Still it is highly improbable that ulcers
on the feet should have afforded the sole and only
cause of buboes; it is much more natural to suppose
that this, as being the more rare case, was for that
very reason brought into special prominence by
the ancient Physicians. Besides we have seen
above that the old Physicians seldom or never really
had an opportunity of seeing the sympathetic buboes,
as patients treated the ulcers themselves, and the
buboes then disappeared spontaneously. Oribasius
no less than other Writers holds buboes following
on an ulcer to be without danger.</p>

<p>Lastly the cases are very rare in which secondary
buboes under the prevailing tendency and course of
the disease are thrown out on the skin, and if they
do arise, the ulcer as a rule heals up. This being
so, the Physician is consulted, only supposing the
buboes refused to disappear. On the contrary if the
ulcer was still there, the Physician sought actually
to stimulate it to enhanced activity, as is distinctly
implied by what <i>Galen</i> says (loco citato). Lint
smeared with <i>tetrapharmacum</i> (compound of wax,
tallow, pitch and resin), liquified by the addition of
<i>oleum rosaceum</i> (oil of roses) was applied and warm
poultices over that; while on the actual bubo was
laid in the first instance wool moistened with oil, to
which when the pain and swelling of the part were
relieved, was added an admixture of salt. Plethoric
or cacochymic (generating evil humours) subjects are
to be bled or cupped. If the bubo is inflamed and
inclined to suppurate, it must be scarified, the
patient having first been purged. Dispersion is then
attempted, in this case by means of pulp and honey
poultices, but not by plasters, as these are apt to
provoke inflammation. If pus appears, recourse must
not be had at once, as some advise, to opening with
the knife; rather the poultices should be persevered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
with till the inflammation is relieved. Acrid poultices
are suitable only when the metathesis to induration
has already begun.</p>

<p>If dispersion does not follow and the matter has
collected in greater quantities, then the most elevated
spot, the same where the skin is the thinnest, should
be opened. Should a part of the skin be discoloured,
it must be cut away. Some advise always cutting
out a piece in the shape of a myrtle-leaf, others
make very long incisions; but this not only causes
a disfiguring scar, but often also interferes with the
movement of the part. As a general rule a single
incision is sufficient, which should be made diagonally
across the inguinal region, not parallel with the
direct diameter of the thigh, as then the edges are
brought actually into contact when the limb bends.<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>
After the opening of the abscess, it should be treated
by preference with finely sifted frankincense, as should
all forms of ulcer. We may mention further that
according to Sextus Placitus Papyriensis<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> the wearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
of a stag’s genitals was considered a <i>prophylactic</i>
against buboes.</p>


<h3>6. Exanthemata on the Genitals.</h3>

<p>Long ago <i>Hensler</i> endeavoured in the Graduation
Theme of his mentioned in the list of Historical
Authorities to prove that certain eruptions occurring
on the genitals were communicated and acquired
as the result of coition. In particular did this
apply above all to <i>herpes</i> (creeping eruption), under
which name must be understood, as is distinctly
implied in a passage of <i>Galen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> a form of eruption
accompanied by ulceration. It is true the passages
of <i>Hippocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> cited by Hensler in regard to the
<i>herpes esthiomenos</i> (eating herpes) would appear to be
open to some doubt and obscurity, while the interpretations
given by <i>Pollux</i> (Onomast. IV. 25. 191.)
<em class="gesperrt">φλυκτίς</em>, φλύκταινα ἐπιμήκες, μάλιστα περὶ
βουβῶνας καὶ μασχάλας. <em class="gesperrt">φύγεθλον</em>, φῦμα περὶ
βουβῶνα μετὰ πυρετοῦ, (φλυκτίς, a long-shaped
blister, particularly in the groin and armpits.
φύγεθλον, a tumour in the groin accompanied by
fever) refer probably only to bubonic swellings;
still these objections hardly apply to the φύματα
(swellings) described in § 32,—the less so as <i>Celsus</i>
himself (VI. 18.) explains: “Tubercula etiam, quae
φύματα Graeci vocant, <em class="gesperrt">circa glandem</em> oriuntur,
quae vel medicamentis vel ferro aduruntur; et cum
crustae exciderunt, squama aeris inspergitur, ne
quid ibi rursus increscat;” (Tuberculous swellings
also, which the Greeks call φύματα, arise <i>about the
glans penis</i>, and are burned away either by caustic
drugs or by the actual cautery. Afterwards when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
the scabs have fallen off, the sore is dusted with
slag of bronze, to prevent any second growth later
on). Moreover it is possible the passage of <i>Galen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
πρὸς δὲ τὰ ἐν αἰδοίοις φυόμενα ἀπίου σπέρμα
ἐπίπασσε καὶ τραγείᾳ χολῇ περιχρῖε. (But for
growths on the privates sprinkle pear-juice and rub
in goat’s gall) may refer to these cases, though no
doubt it may also be held to apply to the tubercles
occurring in the female vagina (§ 41,—3. B.).</p>

<p>Again <i>epinyctis</i> (night-pustule),<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> which Hensler
also mentions but declares to be equally open to
suspicion as to interpretation, would seem hardly
pertinent in this connection, for the violent pain
experienced at once tells against the likelihood of
its being an affection of this class. Its appearance
<i>in eminentibus partibus</i> (on prominent parts, on the
extremities) finds a clear explanation in the words
added by <i>Pollux</i> (loco citato, 197.) περὶ κνήμας καὶ
πόδας ἐν νυκτὶ γενομένη (appearing on legs and
feet during the night); while it is proved that Celsus
meant to indicate nothing else by it from his words
in describing φλυζάκιον (little blister), which he says
occurs <i>raro in medio corpore, saepe in eminentibus
partibus</i>,—rarely on the trunk, frequently on prominent
parts, extremities. Still we do not for a moment
wish to dispute the fact that the male genitals were
at any rate among the Ancients counted as belonging
to the <i>partes eminentes</i>, and as chancrous blebs do
usually appear suddenly and often during the night,
it is quite possible these may have been all along
intended by <i>epinyctis</i>,—especially as on Hippocrates’
authority<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> creeping eruptions (ἕρπητες) arise from
night-pustules (ἐκ τῶν ἐπινυκτίδων.) However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
<i>Pollux</i> (loco citato, 206.) likewise again mentions the
legs and feet (κνήμαις καὶ ποσίν), declaring these
eruptions attack those of elderly people. From this
we may conclude the epinyctis of the Ancient writers
to have been very likely nothing else but that form
of <i>impetigo</i> (scabby eruption) which is vulgarly known
as the <i>salt-flux</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aetius</i><a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> mentions <i>pustulae spontaneae in pudendis</i>
(pustules spontaneously set up on the privates),
provoking <i>phimosis</i>, and describes<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> <i>scabies scroti</i> (scab
of the scrotum) with metathesis into ulceration and
scaliness, after the disappearance of which very often
acute <i>pruritus scroti</i> (itch of the scrotum) is left
behind. <i>Galen</i> (XIX. p. 449.) defines <i>psoriasis scroti</i>
(itching of the scrotum) as a form of induration of
the scrotum accompanied by itching, as well as in
some instances by ulcers.</p>

<p>Under exanthematic types come also the various
<i>condylomata</i>. These when they appeared on the
genitals and in other localities of the body, were
called by the Greeks σῦκος, συκώσις, σύκωμα,
συκώδης ὄγκος, (fig, figlike excrescence, figlike swelling,
figlike lump), by the Romans <i>ficus</i> (fig), whereas
the same disease when it showed itself on the
fundament, received the name of condyloma<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> <i>par
excellence</i>. At the same time this distinction was by
no means strictly observed; in particular the larger
forms of <i>thymus</i> (warty excrescence) were designated
by the name σῦκος (fig), albeit it would seem that
<i>thymus</i> was used as specific name for all protuberances
on the fundament and genitals. Σῦκος or <i>ficus</i> is
according to <i>Galen</i><a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> an ulcerative tubercle secreting
moisture,—the <i>varus</i> (blotchy eruption) on the contrary
being dry, according to <i>Oribasius</i><a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> of circular shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
and reddish colour, hardish and rather painful. It
is found above all on the hairy parts of the body,
the head, chin, fundament and genitals,<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> as the passages
quoted above in § 13 from Martial show. They
occurred, as it would seem, most frequently on the
female genitals, in which situation they are described
so long ago as by <i>Hippocrates</i><a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> under the name of
κιων (pillar, pillar-like excrescence) and said to be
evil-smelling. <i>Aspasia</i><a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> says, “condyloma est rugosa
eminentia. Rugae enim circa os uteri existentes
dum inflammantur, attolluntur et indurantur, tumoremque
ac crassitudinem quandam in locis efficiunt.”
(a condyloma is a wrinkled protuberance. For when
the wrinkles surrounding the orifice of the uterus
grow inflamed, they become prominent and indurated,
occasioning a swelling and thickening in the parts).
<i>Paulus Aegineta</i> (III. 75., VI. 71.) describes them
under the name of <i>hemorrhoids</i> as painful, reddish,
excrescences suffused with blood, which break
(διαλείμμασι), and give off a pale discharge in
drops. Much more common was the appearance of
<i>condylomata on the fundament</i>,<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a><a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> particularly in male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
subjects; in which case they were specially ascribed
to pederastia, as we have already seen. This
makes it impossible to decide definitely which condylomata
were of primary and which of secondary
character; but the fact in no way authorizes us to
deny altogether the occurrence of the latter in
Ancient times.</p>


<h3>7. Morbid Outgrowths on the Genital
Organs.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>σαρκώδη βλαστήματα, verrucae. (fleshy outgrowths, warty
excrescences).</p></blockquote>

<p>The general name θύμος (<i>thymus</i>,—warty excrescence),
or according to Celsus perhaps more correctly
θύμιον (small warty excrescence), appears to have
been used by the Greeks to designate all morbid
outgrowths, and particularly those of the genitals and
fundament, while they appropriated the expressions
σῦκος, ἀκροχορδὸν, and μυρμήκια (fig or figlike
excrescence, wart with a neck, wart growing directly
on the skin) to signify the different subordinate
species. The θύμιον, which <i>Celsus</i><a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> is the first
Writer to delineate in detail, is a warty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
reddish,—according to Paulus Aegineta white too in some
cases, and as a rule painless,—fleshy outgrowth,
slender at the base, broader above, rather hard and
rough at the top. Thus it bears a certain resemblance
to the flower of the thyme, from which circumstance
comes the name. The upper part is easily split, and
then bleeds,—more than might be expected Aëtius
says from its size; the same also sometimes happens
spontaneously. Usually it has the size of an Egyptian
bean, though occasionally it is quite small. Sometimes
one such growth appears, at others several are
found together, now on the palms of the hands, now
on the soles of the feet; but the worst are always
those on the genital organs.</p>

<p>According to <i>Aëtius</i>, who calls the larger sorts
σῦκος (fig), <i>thymus</i> is also found on the fundament
and on the face, in women on the <i>labia</i>, in the
entrance to the vagina and in the vagina itself,
spreading thence to the fundament and even over
the thighs. This is confirmed by <i>Oribasius</i>, who as
well as Paulus Aegineta and perhaps Celsus, distinguishes
a <i>malignant</i> and a <i>non-malignant</i> form. The
non-malignant growths generally disappear of themselves;
but if they are amputated, there remains
behind, so says Celsus, a circular root which penetrates
deep into the flesh; and not only do they grow
again, but further take the character of the malignant
form, become painful and filled with a bloody ichor.
The malignant show themselves both with and without
ulceration, as well as after the disappearance of the
non-malignant growth; they are harder, rougher and
larger, have a dirty livid hue, and are painful,
particularly on being touched. Thymus on the glans
penis is more dangerous than when affecting the
prepuce,<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> more especially if it assume a carcinomatous
character. If of the non-malignant type it should be
lightly scarified with the point of a scalpel, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
some mild escharotic employed, for which the Writer
just named gives several prescriptions. If of the
malignant type, it is according to Paulus Aegineta
either tied with a horse-hair and then removed by
knife or cautery, or according to what Oribasius
says the latter is at once resorted to. But seeing
thymus on the prepuce is often found affecting the
inner and outer surfaces simultaneously, cautery must
not be employed on both at once, for in that way
the foreskin would be destroyed altogether. The
better plan is to begin with those situated on the
inner surface, first cutting them away, then cauterizing,
and finally when they are cicatrized proceeding to
the treatment of the others. But not a few are
incurable.</p>

<p>Ἀκροχορδὸν<a id="FNanchor_432_432" href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> is a smooth, circular, fleshy protuberance,
having a slender circular base, so that it
looks as though it hung on a string, whence the
name. It is painless and callous, usually has the
same colour as the skin, while its dimensions seldom
exceed those of a bean. As a rule several occur
together, but disappear again of their own accord,
especially if they are only small, though on occasion
they get inflamed and suppuration follows; they
leave no root behind on amputation. According to
<i>Galen</i> and <i>Aëtius</i> they occur on the fundament,
according to Philumenes, as given in the latter author,
likewise on the female genitals. They are removed
either by means of a thread or with the lancet,
though escharotics and other acrid remedies are also
employed.</p>

<p>A highly inveterate form is the μυρμήκια, or
<i>formica</i> (ant) of later Writers, which is almost always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
discussed by medical Authors concurrently with
ἀκροχορδόν. It is, Celsus tells us, less prominent
and harder than the θύμιον, has deeper roots, is
more painful, broad at the bass and slender at the
top, less suffused with blood and seldom larger than
a lupin-bean. The colour according to Aëtius is
blackish. On its being touched, the patient has the
sensation of having been bitten by an ant. As an
exactly similar growth appears on the hands, most
Writers, e.g. Celsus and Oribasius, speak only of this
latter; but Aëtius describes it expressly as occurring
on the fundament and on the female genitals; and
it was observed in the latter situation by Philumenes,
or Aëtius (loco citato, ch. 105.) in the case of <i>his own
wife</i>, whom he cured by three days’fumigation with
<i>origanum</i>, (wild-marjoram). Not to mention the usual
escharotic remedies, for which Aëtius in especial
gives several formulæ, the following modes of treatment
recommended by the medical Writers evidently
apply to warts on the hands only,—by extirpation with
a myrtle-leaf shaped scalpel called a <i>scolopomachaerion</i>
(small pointed surgical knife), squeezing off by means
of a quill or metal pipette, and above all sucking
with the lips and gnawing off. This last was in
<i>Galen’s</i> time especially<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> a very fashionable treatment
and is described by him as a new discovery made
at Rome.</p>


<h3><a name="S_42" id="S_42"><small>§ 42.</small></a><br />

Retrospect.</h3>


<p>If we now turn back again and make a brief
survey of the various forms of affections of the
genitals described on preceding pages, comparing
them with those of the present day, such as we have
opportunity to observe in modern times, we think
every unprejudiced reader will be found ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
admit that they agree with these latter in <i>very nearly
every</i> respect whatever, and that <i>every</i> doubt would
be removed, if only the medical Writers had appended
to the records of their observations in each case the
words, “got by infection in coition.” But to what cause
do we refer such cases as a matter of fact, notwithstanding
the denial on the part of the patient that
he has exposed himself to any infection? Do we
not take it for granted as a certainty that such
infection did actually precede? Are we in the habit
of noting down in every instance in our day-book
of cases the antecedent act of coition that occasioned
the chancre or what not; and does this omission
in any way imply that this did not first occur? To
our mind at any rate the fact suffices that non-professional
observers and even a professional one
like Galen have supplied irrefutable evidence that
some of these affections were acquired by coition.
Amongst others, morbid outgrowths for example are
manifestly shown to have been so set up by the
statement that they occurred on the fundament of
pathics; and it needs no great perspicacity to draw
the conclusion that if (unnatural) coition produced
them in the pederast, the same maladies occurring
on the genital organs owed their origin to the same
cause.</p>

<p>But granting these maladies originated in coition,
there must necessarily have been some other factors
active as well, besides the mere act. Thus when
patients are found explaining to the physician (Galen)
that the women with whom they had accomplished
coition suffered from the same evil as themselves
(gonorrhœa), no one surely can suppose anything but
that a transmission of the disease took place in virtue
of a contagion. Such affections of the genitals as
are transmitted in coition by contagion we are wont
to regard as primary forms of Venereal disease; and
those acquired and disseminated in the same way
in Antiquity must accordingly be designated by the
same name. But these primary forms extended not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
only to the genitals; they were equally and in the
same way acquired through the various modes of
<i>Venus illegitima</i> (abnormal Love) in the anus and the
mouth, localities where we are accustomed nowadays
to see the secondary symptoms chiefly appear.
Consequently it was impossible for the Ancients,—and
is really and truly no less so down to the present
moment for the Moderns,—to make a definite distinction
between primary and secondary forms. It
is equally impossible to deny outright the former
existence of the latter in these localities, the more
so as, however wide the dissemination of vicious
practices of various sorts, no very large number of
men suffering from a diseased member are likely to
have misused mouth or anus.</p>

<p>But if we are forced in considering the secondary
forms to leave mouth and anus almost entirely out
of the question,<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> then only cutaneous diseases and
those affecting the bones are left us, for <i>ozaena</i> (fetid
polypus), which was regarded as incurable by the
Ancient physicians,<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> cannot any more than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
others be taken into account in connection with
primary affections of the mouth, unless indeed we
are prepared to look upon the ῥέγχειν (snorting)
of the men of Tarsus as a secondary complaint of
pathics.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>cutaneous affections</i>, we have seen
how the forms of <i>lichen</i> and <i>mentagra</i> passed over
into <i>psora</i> and <i>lepra</i> (§§ 23, 25), and how the conclusion
to be drawn from this is plain, viz. that the secondary
cutaneous forms of Venereal disease were formerly
assigned as belonging to leprosy. This seems to be
confirmed by a passage of <i>Johannes Moschus</i><a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> that
has only just been brought under our notice, in
which it is related how a monk of the Monastery
of Penthula could no longer master the appeals of
the flesh, travelled to Jericho to get relief from the
“superfluity of his naughtiness” in a brothel in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
place; how when he had entered the house, he was
suddenly attacked by leprosy, whereupon he speedily
returned to his Monastery. How much Venereal
disease has in common with elephantiasis must be
determined by later investigations. At any rate it
is worth while to note its frequent occurrence in
Egypt, its establishment in Italy along with the
various forms of <i>lichen</i>, its infectiousness, as well as
the statement of Celsus (III. 25.), who calls it an
<i>ignotus paene in Italia morbus</i> (a disease almost
unknown in Italy), and that even the bones would
appear to be affected by it.</p>

<p>Lastly, inasmuch as the tendency of the morbid
process to strike outwards to the skin was conditioned
by the influence of climate, while cutaneous
forms of Venereal disease were amongst the most
common of occurrences, it follows that not only were
affections of the mucous membranes bound to fall
proportionally into the background and appear with
less frequency, but those of the bones as well. Still
the mucous membranes <i>were</i> sometimes attacked,
and <i>affections of the bones</i> did also undoubtedly
occur, though with incomparably greater rarity,—such
affections being, as is well known, at the
present day of rare occurrence, and especially so
in hot climates. Corrosion of the tibia is mentioned
by Plutarch, and peculiar pains of the periosteum,
which are so deep-seated and stable as to make the
patient believe the bones themselves to be the seat
of the mischief, are spoken of as early as by
<i>Archigenes</i> cited by <i>Galen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_437_437" href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> the latter adding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
these pains were commonly known as οστοκοποι
(racking the bones). If further we ought to count
in this connection those forms of <i>exostosis</i> (morbid
excrescence) <i>of the bones of the skull</i> described above
in § 26, which it seems were so prevalent among
the inhabitants of Cyprus as to have gained for the
island according to some authorities its name of
Κεραστία (horned),<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> we should actually have to hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
proofs of the existence in Antiquity of <i>all</i> the
symptoms that at the present day constitute Venereal
disease. All we need to do is to unite these into
one general picture and give the name that is now
sanctioned by custom, in order to arrive at the final
result,—that <i>Venereal Disease</i>, though not recognized
and described as such by the Ancient Physicians,
<i>was as a matter of fact existent in Antiquity</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>Having reached this general result at the conclusion
of the first Part of our Investigations, we would now
seem only to have to co-ordinate the various pieces
of evidence thus far brought together without reference
to time and place, but merely on the principle of
similarity of contents, under local and temporal
conditions, in order to obtain a general exposition
of <i>the development of Venereal Disease in Antiquity</i>.
Willing as we may be to undertake the task, and
necessary as its performance is,—for it is precisely
this that constitutes the History properly so called
of the Disease,—still we must freely admit that for
the present the fixed data indispensable for the work
are too few to enable us to do more than offer
suggestive hints. At the same time to supply these
missing data by hypotheses that must necessarily
lack all positive grounds, is not, at any rate in our
opinion, consistent with the dignity and duty of a
Historian.</p>

<p>As to the <i>local</i> determinations, those defining the
places, to which such or such information given us
belongs, are extremely scanty, and such as they are,
we owe them mainly to the non-professional Authors.
Among the Physicians, who from the nature of the
case must be chiefly considered here, they are all
but entirely wanting; true they are almost all Greek
instances, still in the majority of cases it is left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
absolutely undetermined whether the observations,
the mere results of which moreover are given us,
were made in Greece, at Rome or in Asia Minor.
But even supposing knowledge amounting to certainty
<i>were</i> available on this point, yet the local range as
compared with the whole Ancient world is too
limited to entitle us to use it successfully as evidence
in drawing up a general History of the Disease.</p>

<p>The <i>temporal</i> determinations are in no better case.
This is especially so where the Physicians are concerned;
not to mention the general uncertainty as
to the epoch at which most of them lived and made
their observations, they are for the most part bad
witnesses for this reason if for no other, that they
have obviously copied one from another, or at any rate
so far as their works are extant for our examination,
utilized,—with the possible exception of Galen,—certain
common sources of information, which unfortunately
have been completely lost. The loss is
the more to be deplored as the authorities in question
belonged just to the most flourishing period of scientific
Medicine, that of the Alexandrian physicians.</p>

<p>Yet another drawback is that up to the present
we are entirely without information as to the consecutive
order of the series of epidemics in Antiquity,
by the indirect help of which alone do the historical
factors conditioning Venereal disease become discernible;
while so far as appears, there is no
reasonable hope of our ever attaining any clearer
light on the point. Nay! even if we did possess
the information, it could only apply to Greece, Rome
and Asia Minor, for as previously pointed out, in
countries situated in the hot Zone the <i>genius epidemicus</i>
(general consensus of epidemic conditions) is but
rarely as a rule strong enough to override the <i>genius
endemicus</i> (general consensus of endemic conditions).
As much therefore as can in such a state of things
be predicated with some basis of reason as not
entirely hypothetical may be pretty well summed up
as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>Diseases of the genital organs developed little by
little among nearly all the Peoples of Antiquity
known to us at all intimately under the favouring
conditions detailed in preceding pages. At the same
time in virtue of the large number of counteracting
influences they seldom attained to any high degree
of intensity, and remained mostly local, taking the form
of mucous discharges and superficial ulcers, without
provoking any general reaction of the organism.
Even when such reaction did occur, it was the skin
that felt it, in such a way as to throw off the effects
of morbid activity in the form of cutaneous maladies.
These conditions lasted usually as long as the different
Peoples continued to cultivate mutual exclusiveness;
directly they abandoned this, and individual members
of different foreign stocks began to combine to gratify
an unbridled licentiousness, affections of the genitals
not only increased in frequency, but over and
above this a malignant character was stamped upon
them, with which both the development and the
intensity of any particular contagion stood in direct
ratio.</p>

<p>Examples are to be found in the Plague of Baal
Peor among the Jews at Shittim (§§ 8. and 9. above),
in the introduction of the cult of Dionysus at
Athens (§ 98.) and of Priapus at Lampsacus (§ 7.),
both of which latter are connected with the March
of Bacchus to and from India, as well as lastly in
the introduction of the Lingam-worship in India
itself (§ 6.). All these phænomena point to the
conclusion that a remarkable frequency and malignity
of affections of the genitals was connected with
influences conditioned from without, amongst which
we have to reckon the general epidemic conditions.
This becomes the more interesting and important
from the fact that we meet with the same thing
again in the XVth. Century, a period when the
incorrect view taken of the circumstances led to the
most contradictory opinions being held. However
both influences and effects were merely transitory, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
is proved by the unanimous consensus of authorities
that the phænomena provoked by the conditions
disappeared again after a certain interval of time,
an interval that seems among the Jews only to have
lasted somewhat longer under endemic influence.</p>

<p>Still under no circumstances does this justify us
in arguing to a total absence of all affections of the
genital organs,—as is proved, no doubt after an
interval of more than a thousand years, (if indeed
we are to admit the occurrences just mentioned to
count at all as actual historical facts), by (1) the
general weather conditions laid down by Hippocrates
and their consequences, and (2) an event that probably
was connected with the same conditions, the
Plague of Athens described by Thucydides. Here
we find indisputable proof given us that affections
of the genitals, as also most likely the contagion
conditioning them, increased under favourable epidemic
influence in frequency, malignity and intensity,
while concurrently the secondary forms manifested
themselves pre-eminently by symptoms of an exanthematic
type.</p>

<p>For close on five hundred years onwards we are
again left without information; but the statements
contributed by Celsus show that meantime there
had been ample opportunities of observing and
treating affections of the genitals. In the time of
Pompey the Great, when Themison made his
observations on the wide prevalence of satyriasis in
Crete, there was developed, it would appear, though
from what causes is not known, a general consensus
of predominantly exanthematic conditions, that seems
to have continued for a long period of time, no
doubt as was to be expected with sundry interruptions
intervening. Under favour of these conditions
was developed in the first instance elephantiasis,
and later on under the Emperor Claudius <i>mentagra</i>,
which above all in Martial’s time afflicted the
Romans, while caricous tumours (<i>ficus</i>) became an
every-day complaint. From that epoch onwards, direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
historical evidences more and more tend to disappear,
till eventually it is only in the prescription-books of
Physicians that we gather any inkling of the continued
necessity for medical aid and concurrently of the
existence of Venereal Disease.</p>

<i>Festus</i>, p. 135., says:
<i>Rumen</i> est pars colli, qua
esca devoratur (The <i>rumen</i>, or
gullet, is that part of the neck,
where food is swallowed).
<i>Nonius</i>, p. 18.: rumen dicitum
locus in ventre, quo cibus
sumitur et unde redditur
(rumen was applied to the
locality in the belly to which
food is taken in and from
which it is given back).—<i>Isidore</i>,
Etymolog. bk. XII.
37., Ruminatio autem dicta
est a <i>ruma</i>, eminente gutturis
parte, per quam dimissus cibus
a certis animalibus revocatur
(Now rumination is so called
from the <i>ruma</i>, or gullet, the
upper portion of the throat,
by which food after being
swallowed is brought up again
by certain animals). It is
true <i>Varro</i> gives another
explanation: ruminare propter
<i>rumam</i>, id est prisco vocabulo
mammam (to ruminate so
called on account of the <i>ruma</i>,
that is in old Latin the breast);
and so one might equally
well understand by <i>irrumare</i>
the custom of voluptuaries,
one that is still practised, of
employing the space between
the bosoms as <i>vagina</i>. At
any rate <i>Dr. Hacker</i> of Leipzig
assured the author he had
on several occasions observed
cases where prostitutes had
chancrous swellings between
the bosoms, as well as under
the arm-pits,—for these also
are employed with the same
object.—Does <i>ruma</i> possibly
stand for <i>rima</i> (a chink)? In
any case we should compare
what <i>Suidas</i> gives under the
words ῥῦμα, ῥῦμη and ῥύμματα.
Synonyms are <i>comprimere
linguam</i>, <i>buccam
offendere</i>, etc. (to compress
the tongue, to hit against the
cheek).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="label">2</a>
The etymology of <i>fellare</i>
is still obscure. <i>Vossius</i>,
Etymolog., derives it from the
Æolic φηλᾶν for θηλᾶν and
θηλάζειν, to suck the breasts.
<i>Pliny</i>, Hist. Nat. bk. XI.
65., says of the tongue of
cats: imbricatae asperitatis ac
limae similis, attenuansque
lambendo cutem hominis (of
a ridged roughness of surface,
like a file, capable of wearing
through the human skin by
licking). The meanings which
<i>Suidas</i> gives under φελλά,
etc. would seem to point to
an old stem φέλλω,—to
roughen, to file.</p></div>

σε καὶ <em class="gesperrt">φοινικίζειν</em>; (for translation see
text above); as to φοινικίζειν,
this will be discussed
later on. The word λεσβιάζειν
occurs in Aristophanes,
Frogs 1335; and he also
uses λεσβιεῖν in the same
sense, Wasps, 1386., μέλλουσαν
ἤδη λεσβιεῖν τοὺς
ξυμπότας; (a girl standing
ready to λεσβιεῖν—love in the
Lesbian mode,—the revellers).
On this passage the Scholiast
remarks: ἵνα μὴ τὸ παλαιὸν
τοῦτο καὶ θρυλλούμενον δι’
ἡμετέρων στομάτων εἴπω
σόφισμα, ὅ φασι παῖδας
Λεσβίων εὑρεῖν. (this ancient
trick, a matter of common
gossip to any in our mouths,
which they say the children
of the Lesbians invented).—<i>Suidas</i>
s. v. <em class="gesperrt">Λεσβίαι</em>·
μολύναι τὸ στόμα. Λέσβιοι
γὰρ διεβάλλοντο ἐπὶ αἰσχρότητι.
(under the word Λεσβίαι—Lesbian
women, to defile
the mouth. For the Lesbians
were reproached for foulness).
<i>Hesychius</i>: λεσβιάζειν· πρὸς
ἄνδρα στόμα στύειν. Λεσβιάδας
γὰρ τὰς λαικαστρίας
ἔλεγον. (to play the Lesbian;
to use the mouth to a man
for an obscene purpose. For
they used to call wanton
courtesans Lesbians). <i>Eustathius</i>,
Comment. ad Homeri
Iliad, p. 741., εἰσὶ βλασφημίαι

Ἀττικοί, σκωπτόμενοι ὡς
κακολόγοι, καθὰ καὶ οἱ
Σφήττιοι ἐπὶ ἀγριότητι.
(And there are many reproaches
applying to nations,
and cities, and demes, implied
in the use of certain words; for
instance in the case of nations,
to play the Cilician, and to
play the Egyptian, i. e. to be
a rogue, and to play the
Cretan, i.e. to be a liar;
again, in the case of cities,
to act the Lesbian, i. e. to
act filthily; further we may
bring forward a passage of
Pherecrates in Iambic verse,
viz. the line, “And he shall give
thee seven Lesbian women,”
to which the answering verse
is, “Verily! a noble gift, to
get seven harlots,” implying
that such was the character
of the Lesbian women. Lastly
an example of such a reproach
applying to demes, to play
the Æxonian, in other words
to be foul-mouthed. For the
Æxonians were Attic demes-men,
ridiculed as being evil-speakers
in the same way as
the Sphettians were on the
ground of rusticity). The
word σόφισμα (trick) in the
passage of the Scholiast to
Aristophanes explains the
word “dogma” in Martial,
bk. IX. 48., Dic mihi, percidi,
Pannice, <i>dogma</i> quod est?
(Tell me, Pannicus, what is
the trick of the paederast?).
<i>Theopompus</i> in “Ulysses”
says: δι’ἡμετέρων στομάτων
εἴπω σόφισμ’ὅ φασι παῖδας
Λεσβίων εὑρεῖν. (a certain
trick common in our mouths
which they say children of the
Lesbians invented). <i>Strattis</i>
in “Pytisus”: τῷ στόματι
δράσω ταῦθ’ἅπερ τοῦ
αἰσχροῦ τάττεται [ταῦθ’
ἅπερ οἱ Λέσβιοι]. (with my
mouth I will do those things
that are reckoned as obscene,—those
things that the Lesbians
do).]</p></div>

<i>Hippocrates</i>, Bk. II.
sect. 2. edit. Kühn, Vol. III.
p. 436., Καὶ ἡ Στυμαργέω
ἐκ ταραχῆς ὀλιγημέρου
πολλὰ στήσασα, κ. τ. λ. (And
the female slave of Stymargeos
having after a few days’disturbance
re-established much,
etc.)—The same passage occurs
in <i>Galen</i>, Comments on the
Epid. bk. II. edit. Kühn,
Vol. XVII. A. p. 324., with
an explanation of the subject-matter,
and also has Στυμαργέω.—<i>Ibidem</i>,
p. 458.,
ἡ <em class="gesperrt">Στυμάργεω</em> οἰκέτις ἡ
<em class="gesperrt">Ἰδουμαια</em> ἐγένετο, κ. τ. λ.
(the female slave of Stymargeos,
the Idumaean, was, etc.).—<i>GaleἸδουμαῖαn</i>
cites the passage, <i>loco
citato</i> p. 467., without comment,
but he likewise reads
Στυμάργεω. In two other
passages, in which he comments
on the statements last
quoted from Hippocrates, the
text is obviously corrupt. In
“De tremore, palpitatione,
convulsione et rigore” (Of
Trembling, Palpitation, Convulsion
and Rigor), edit. Kühn,
vol. III. p. 602, it reads:
Ἐστυμάργεω οἰκέτις, ᾗ οὐδὲ
αἵμα ἐγένετο, ὡς ἔτεκε
θυγατέρα, κ. τ. λ. (a female
slave of Estymargeos, in whose
case flowed no blood at all,
when she gave birth to a
daughter, etc.). Also <i>Assmann</i>
in his Index to Kühn’s Edition
of Galen, pp. 232 and 307.,
represents it by <i>Estymergi
ancilla</i> (a female slave of
Estymergus). However there
can be no doubt Ἡ Στυμάργεω
οἰκέτις (The female
slave of Stymargeos) ought
to be read in Galen; on the
other hand we see clearly
from this passage that the
text of Hippocrates is quite
wrong in giving the Proper
name ἡ Ἰδουμαῖα (the
Idumaean), and this, as indeed
the sense too requires, must
be changed into ᾗ αἵμα οὐδὲ
(in whose case not even blood);
and one is more especially
convinced of this on reading
the explanation given by
<i>Galen</i>, <i>loco citato</i>. Besides
this, following Galen’s lead,
we should read δεῖ ἐλθεῖν
for διελθεῖν and προφάσεως
for προφάσιος. Also he has
ἀφορμὴν instead of ἀχὴν.—The
<i>second</i> passage of <i>Galen</i>
occurs in the “De venae
sectione” (On the opening
of a Vein) adv. Erasistrat.,
ch. 5.: ἐκεῖνο δέ πως
εἴρηται; <em class="gesperrt">ἐκ τοῦ μαργέω</em>
οἰκέτιδος <em class="gesperrt">οὐδὲ αἵμα ἐγένετο</em>,
ὡς ἔτεκε θυγατέρα,
ἀπέστραπτο τὸ στόμα <em class="gesperrt">πρός</em>
[τῆς μήτρας καὶ ἐς] ἰσχίον
καὶ σκέλος ὀδύνη, παρὰ
σφυρὸν τμηθεῖσα <em class="gesperrt">ἐράϊσε</em>
[ἐῤῥῄισε], καίτοι τρόμοι τὸ
σῶμα <em class="gesperrt">περικατεῖχον</em> [πᾶν
κατεῖχον]· ἀλλ’ἐπὶ τὴν
πρόφασιν <em class="gesperrt">χρὴ ἐλθεῖν</em>
καὶ τῆς προφάσεως <em class="gesperrt">τὴν
τροφήν</em>.  (Now how is this
account given? from a female
slave of Stymargeos not even
blood flowed, when she gave
birth to a daughter; the
mouth was distorted from (the
womb, and in) loin and leg
there was pain; on being cut
(bled) on the ankle, she found
relief, though shudderings ran
down the (whole) body; but
we must go to the cause,
and the origin of the cause).
Here too it is evident, besides
the emendations already
pointed out as necessary, we
must read ἐκ Στυμάργεω, as
the edition of Kühn, vol. XI.
p. 161., does actually and
rightly read. <i>Dioscorides</i> may
be right so far, that the word,
<i>strictly speaking</i>, is not a
“Nomen proprium” (Proper
name), but in the passage
named it stands for one, if
only, as is likely enough, for
a nickname, as it is called.

Μύζουσις is cited by

XVII. p. 1821. 52. and
XIV. p. 1921. end, as also
ἀπομύζουρις on Iliad XI. p.
867. 44., in the sense of
<i>fellatrix</i>, παρὰ τὸ μυζᾶν,
ἤγουν θηλάζειν οὐράν. (connected
with μυζᾶν, to suck,
that is to say to suck like
an infant a man’s member).
<i>Suidas</i> says: μυζεῖ καὶ μύζει,
θηλάζει λείχει μῦ, μύζει· ἀπὸ
τοῦ μῦ παρῆκται τὸ μύζειν,
πολλοῖς ἄλλοις ὁμοίως· μύζειν
δέ ἐστι τὸ τοῖς μυκτῆρσιν
ἦχον ἀποτελεῖν. <em class="gesperrt">Ἀριστοφάνης</em>
τί μύζεις,—(μυζεῖ
and μύζει,—sucks like an
infant, licks with a <i>mooing</i>
noise, <i>moos</i>); from this <i>mooing</i>
noise is derived μύζειν as is
the case with other similar
words; now μύζειν is to produce
the noise made in the
nostrils in the act of sucking.
Aristophanes has τί μύζεις;
(what is the mooing noise you
make?) On this passage of
Aristophanes (Thesmoph. 238.)
the Scholiast observes: τοῦτο
δὲ φώνημα σημαίνει ἔκλυσίν
τινα ἀφροδισιαστικήν· ὅθεν
καὶ μύται ἐλέγοντο τὸ παλαιὸν
ἀφροδισιασταὶ καὶ
γυναικομανεῖς. (Now this
sound proclaims a certain dissoluteness
in lovemaking;
whence of old voluptuaries and
men mad after women were
called also μύται). Μῦς, the
mouse, also comes from the
same stem, from its picking
and gnawing; so does μυῖα,
the fly, and as <i>Aelian</i>, Hist.
Anim. bk. XV. ch. 1., says
of a fish, ὑποχανὼν κατέπιε
τῆν μυῖαν (it gaped its mouth
and swallowed down the fly),
we might perhaps read
μυιοχάνη after flies, as if she
wanted to catch flies, a fly-catcher,
fly-trap, unless indeed
we prefer to take μυιοχάνη
as being a compound-word
expressing a high degree of
lecherousness. The lecherous
nature of the fly is well-known,
as well as their habit of licking,
which makes <i>Varro</i>, de Re
Rust. III. ch. 15., say: Non
ut muscae <i>liguriunt</i>. (They
do not <i>lick</i>, like flies). Ligurire
(to lick) is used in the sense
of <i>fellare</i> and <i>cunnilingere</i>.
<i>Aelian</i>, Hist. Anim. bk. IV.
ch. 5., mentions a fish, χάνη,
which is particularly lustful:
χάνη δὲ ἰχθὺς λαγνίστατος
(Now the χάνη is a most lustful
fish). Again μυσαροχάνη
(μυσαρὸς, filthy) would be a
significant word for a <i>fellatrix</i>.</p>

ἀθυροστομέω (unrestrained
of mouth, unrestrainedness
of mouth, to be unrestrained

<i>Epicrates</i> said of a lecherous

<i>Aelian</i>, Hist. Anim. Bk. XII.

similar expression, μυωνίαν
ὅλην ὀνομάσας (having named
her a complete mouse-hole);
she is a perfect mouse-hole,
in other words she has as many
entrances as a mouse-hole.
Instead of μυριοχαύνη we
might also read μυριομήχανος

to the <i>fessus mille

modes of pleasure) in <i>Martial</i>,

Perhaps the word was

a certain fish, for in
<i>Athenaeus</i>, Deipnos. p. 591.,
σαπέρδιον (the diminutive) is
the nick-name of a <i>hetaera</i>,
and when <i>Diogenes</i> (Diogenes
Laertius, VI. 2. 6.) made a
scholar wear a σαπέρδης, the
latter threw it away (ὑπ’
αἰδοῦς ῥίψας), (having cast
it from him in disgust). Note
at the same time that the word
<i>Sarapis</i> also occurs in <i>Plautus</i>
(Paenulus V. 5. 30 sqq.),
where Anthemonides says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent2">Ligula, i in malam crucem</div>
  <div class="verse">Tune hic amator audes esse, hallex viri?</div>

Skinned sprat, <i>Sarapis</i> of the
corn-crops, sheepskin, common
salt of the market; and yet
reeking worse of garlic and
leek than Roman bargees!).
To restore this undoubtedly
corrupt text is beyond our
powers, but this much at any
rate results from the passage
as a whole that <i>Sarapis</i> or
<i>Sarrapis</i> here too signifies a
vicious man. Anthemonides
certainly takes Hanno, to
whom this speech is addressed,
for a <i>cinaedus</i>, for he says
later on: “nam te cinaedum
esse arbitror magis quam
virum” (but I reckon you to
be a cinaedus rather than a
man), and he had previously
said: “Quis hic homo est
<i>cum tunicis longis</i>, quasi puer
cauponius?” (Who is this
fellow <i>with the long tunics</i>,
like a waiter at a cookshop?)
and “Sane genus hoc muliebrosum
est tunicis demissitiis.”
(Surely this is a womanish
sort, <i>with his trailing tunics</i>).
Similarly <i>Turnebus</i>, Adversar.
bk. X. ch. 24., mentions the
fact that <i>Hesychius</i> explains
σάραπις by περσικὸς χιτὼν
(a Persian tunic). However he
prefers to read, instead of
<i>Sarrapis, arra pisa ementium</i>,
(pledge of such as buy
at the price of one pea) in reference
to the vice of Bacchus,
“obscoenum et mollem virum,
qui pro arra dari possit vilis
mercimonii.” (a foul and deboshed
man, fit only to be
given as pledge at the value
of any cheap commodity).</p></div>

Comp. the passage of
Lucian quoted on p. 229
above. <i>Suetonius</i>, Tiberius
ch. 44., “Majore adhuc et
turpiore infamia flagravit, vox
ut referri audirive, nedum
credi, fas sit. Quasi pueros
primae teneritudinis, quos
pisciculos vocabat, institueret,
ut natanti sibi <i>inter femina
versarentur</i> ac luderent, lingua
et morsu sensim appetentes,
atque etiam quasi infantes
firmiores, necdum tamen lacte
depulsos, inguini seu papillae
admoveret; pronior sane ad
id genus libidinis et natura et
aetate. Quare Parrhasii quoque
tabulam, in qua Meleagro
Atalanta ore morigeratur,
legatam sibi sub conditione,
ut si argumento offenderetur,
decies pro ea sestertium acciperet,
non modo praetulit,
sed et in cubiculo dedicavit.”
(He was guilty of a yet more
flagrant and abominable villainy,
so much so it hardly
admits of being related or
listened to, let alone believed,
to this effect. He arranged
that boys of tender years,
whom he called his little fishes,
should move about between
his thighs, as he swam, and
play there making darts at
him with tongue and mouth
and biting him softly; also
infants of somewhat stronger
growth, but still not yet weaned,
he would put to his member
as if to their mothers’teat,
being indeed both by natural
disposition and time of life
more apt to this form of
indulgence. So when a picture
of Parrhasius, in which Atalanta
is represented <i>gratifying</i>
Meleager with her
mouth, was willed to him with
the stipulation that, if he
objected to the subject, he
should have a million serterces
instead, not only did he choose
the painting, but actually enshrined
it in his bed-chamber).

<i>Hesychius</i>, and explained by
some Commentators as
“stretching the legs apart”.
In <i>Suidas</i> σαίρειν is explained
by <i>hiare</i> (to gape
open); and the Lexicographers
give σάραβος as meaning
γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον (a
woman’s privates) and the
word is found in <i>Dio Chrysostom</i>,

as the name of a Tavern-keeper,—also
if we are not
mistaken, in Plato. σάρων

γυναικεῖον (woman’s parts).
He also has ἀρρενώπες
(masculine-looking), which
some interpret by Androgyne
(man-woman) or <i>fellator</i>. The
reading ἀγράπους occurring,

makes, by whom a particular
thing is done! For the very

fame or obscurity of the doers
are raised to the topmost
pinnacle or brought down to
the lowest depth. I was sailing
along our Lake of Larius, when
my companion and elder pointed
out a certain country house to
me, nay, a particular bed-room,
which projects into the Lake.
From this chamber, he said,
some time ago a fellow-countrywoman
of ours threw
herself, along with her husband.
I asked the reason. <i>The husband,
it seemed, in consequence
of a disease of long
standing was rotting with
ulcers on the private parts
of the body. The wife demanded
a right to look; for
she thought no one else likely
to give a more conscientious
opinion than herself as to
whether he could be cured.
She saw, and despaired of
recovery; so she urged him
to die, and herself was companion
of his death, giving
in fact at once incitement,
example and compulsion to
the deed.</i> This achievement I
had never, though a man of
the country, heard of till that
moment; not because it was
a whit less glorious than Arria’s
renowned exploit, but solely
because the doer was less
famous. Farewell).</p></div>

(’Tis winter time, and the
shuddering chill of December
is upon us. None the less,
Linus, you dare to greet with
your frosty salute all men you
meet here and there, and to
kiss all Rome. What more
disagreeable or more cruel
could you do, if you had been
struck or thrashed? With an
embrace so chilling may no
wife kiss me, or unripe maid
with wheedling lips. But you,—you
think yourself more
attractive and more pleasing,
you from whose dog-like nose
a blue icicle hangs, whose
beard is frozen stiff, such a
beard as the Cilician shearer
crops with his upward-pointing
clippers from the chin of a
Cinyphian he-goat. I had rather
meet a hundred <i>cunnilingues</i>;
I am less afraid of a Gaul new
come to town. Wherefore, if
you possess any sense or any
shame, I do beseech you,
Linus, defer your wintry
salutes till April is come).
Now <i>Linus</i> is designated by
<i>Martial</i>, bk. VII. Epigr. 9,
as a <i>fellator</i>, and bk. XI.
Epigr. 26., as a <i>cunnilingue</i>.</p></div>

Whence also the proverbial
saying in <i>Suidas</i>: κύνα
δέρειν δεδαρμένην· τὸ τοῦ
Φερεκράτους· σχῆμα δέ ἐστι
ἀκόλαστον εἰς τὸ αἰδοῖον·
εἴρηται δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ, ἄλλο
πασχόντων αὖθις ἐφ’οἷς
πεπόνθασιν ἡ παροιμία. (to
skin the skinned bitch; expression
of Pherecrates; is an
abominable practice in connection
with the private parts;
the proverb is spoken of such
as suffer something a second
time over, after having suffered
it once already). Similarly
<i>Plautus</i>, Trinum. II. 4. 27.,
Edepol <i>mutuum</i> mecum facit
(By my faith, he plays give
and take with me). Again
κυνάμυια (shameless fly) is
found in <i>Suidas</i>, which he
explains by ἀναιδεστάτη·
παρεσχημάτικε τὸ ὄνομα
ἀπὸ τοῦ κυνὸς καὶ τῆς
μυίας· ὁ μὲν γὰρ κύων
ἀναιδής, ἡ δὲ μυῖα θρασεῖα,
(a most shameless woman:
name borrowed figuratively
from the dog and the fly; for
the dog is shameless, and the
fly audacious)—probably with
a reference to <i>Homer</i>, II.
XXI. 394., where κυνόμυια
is found, and the Scholiast
observes: ἀναιδής ὡς μυῖα,
ἐκ δύο ἀναιδῶν τελείων,
τοῦ τε κυνός καὶ τὴς μυίας,
διὰ τὸ ὑπερβάλλον τῆς ἀναιδείας.
(shameless as a fly;
from two completely shameless
creatures, the dog and
the fly; on account of the excessive
degree of their shamelessness).
Further there is in
this connection the word
κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog), which
was a nick-name of <i>Philostratus</i>,
as we see from <i>Aristophanes</i>,
Knights 1078., on
which passage the Scholiast
observes: λέγει δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ
πορνοβοσκὸν καὶ καλλωπιστὴν
(now he calls him both
brothel-keeper and dandy). If
we derive the word from τὸν κύνα
(frenulum praeputii,—ligament
of the prepuce,—Paulus
Aegineta, VI. 54.)
ἀλωπίζειν, it would designate
the <i>fellator</i>, as ἀλωπὸς,
ἀλωπίζειν, ἀλωπηκίζω is
formed from α privative (negative)
and λῶπος, λώπη (the
covering, skin, wool); and
ἀλωπηκία is to be explained
in the same way,—but not
from the scab or mange of
the fox, nor yet as the Etymologicum
Magnum would
have it, because the places
where the fox discharges his
urine die, the grass e.g. dries
up and withers. Hence ἀλώπηξ
might be taken as <i>bald-headed</i>,
and then the further meaning
of licentious dissoluteness given
to it, for in Antiquity baldness
was very usually looked upon
as a consequence of sexual
excesses, and as every one
knows, Caesar was called by
his soldiers <i>moechus calvus</i>
(the bald-headed adulterer).
But old men, who in particular
are bald-headed, especially
practised, owing to their lack
of the power of erecting the
penis, the vice of <i>irrumation</i>
and of the <i>cunnilingue</i>, which
makes <i>Martial</i> say (IV. 50.)
<i>Nemo est, Thai, senex ad
irrumandum</i> (No one, Thais,
is too old a man for irrumation).
κυναλώπηξ would then
be a <i>bald-headed cunnilingue</i>.
Possibly however this idea
was also partly due to a
reminiscence of the fox’s habit,
when desirous of following up
a scent, of sticking his head
to the ground (<i>Aelian</i>, Hist.
Anim. VI. ch. 24.),—a manœuvre
he also adopts, as is
generally known, when dying.
In evidence of this view may
be quoted what <i>Cicero</i>, Orat.
pro Domo ch. 18., says to
Sextus Clodius: <i>ligurris</i> (you
are a licker), and ch. 31.
Quaere hoc ex Sexto Clodio,
iube adesse, latitat omnino;
sed si requiri iusseris, invenient
hominem apud sororem tuam
(Publii Clodii) <i>occultantem se
capite demisso</i> (Require this
of Sextus Clodius, bid him
appear; he lurks entirely out
of sight. But if once you
order him to be sought out,
they will find the man at
your sister’s house (Publius
Clodius’s) <i>hiding himself with
head held down</i>.) Comp. <i>Catullus</i>,
87. In <i>Martial</i>, Bk. IV.
Epigr. 53., <i>canis</i> is used in
same sense as κύων in Greek,—apparently?
Perhaps the
women of Antiquity made use
of dogs as well to serve as
<i>cunnilingues</i>. According to
<i>Brockhusius</i> on Tibullus I.
7. 32., II. 4. 32. they were
usual companions of “ladies
of pleasure” at Rome, whence
too <i>suburanae canes</i> (bitches
of the Subura) in <i>Horace</i>,
Epod. V. 58. and <i>Subura
vigilax</i> (the watchful Subura)
in <i>Propertius</i>, IV. 7. 15.
During the Middle Ages at
any rate such an employment
of dogs was nothing unusual.
This is stated by <i>Panormita</i>,
Hermaph. Epigr. XXX.,

It is evident from this
that Meier in his above mentioned
Article on Paederastia
is wrong in citing the expression
αἰσχρουργὸς (worker of
obscenities) as being used
for the direct equivalent of
<i>cinaedus</i>. Incidentally we
would take this opportunity
of further observing that the
word παιδοκόραξ (boy-raven,
i.e. a person ravenous after
boys), which is also mentioned
in the same Article as synonymous
with <i>cinaedus</i>, is
wrongly referred to paederastia,
for it really, like the
Latin <i>corvus</i> (raven), signifies
a <i>fellator</i>. Its true explanation
is given in <i>Pliny</i>, Hist. Nat.
bk. X. ch. 15., Corvi pariunt
cum plurimum quinos. <i>Ore
eos parere aut coire vulgus
arbitratur.</i> (Ravens produce
at most a brood of five each
pair. <i>The vulgar believe these
birds produce or copulate
with the mouth).</i>—Aristoteles
(De gen anim. Bk. III. ch. 6.)
negat,—sed illam exosculationem,
quae saepe cernitur,
qualem in columbis, esse.
(Aristotle denies this,—but
adds that there is the same
billing, which is often noticed,
as with doves). Hence also

<p>
(Fly the Alpheus’mouth; he
loves the bosom of Arethusa,
<i>falling headlong into the salt

cited the following passage
from <i>Aristophanes</i>, Knights
1086, 87.,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">ΑΛ. Καὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ γῆς καὶ τῆς ἐρυθρᾶς γε θαλάσσης</div>

<p>
(Verily for me you shall be

pickles). Here ἐπίπαστα
is, as probably also
in v. 103., the Salgama
(pickles in brine) of <i>Ausonius</i>,
Epigr. 125.; which moreover
affords at any rate a partial
explanation of the passage in
<i>Pollux</i>, Onomast. bk. VI. ch.
9. p. 61., bk. X. ch. 24. p. 96.
Still, even if according to this
<i>Phoenicia</i> were used in the
sense of the genital organs of
women at time of menstruation,
it by no means follows that
φοινικίζειν meant <i>only</i> to
have dealings with women in
menstruation, any more than
it does that it is identical with
καταμηνίου πίνων (drinking
of menstrual blood), as it has
been shown just above not
to be. In fact <i>Galen</i> says
explicitly: φαίνεταί μοι
παραπλήσιον, (it appears to
me to be something <i>similar!</i>)</p></div>

<i>Pollux</i>, Onomast IV. ch.

forms of wasting-diseases
φθίνης νόσος, for which some
editors, and quite rightly,
prefer to read φθίνας νόσος
(wasting disease). <i>Suidas</i> also
says φθίνας ἡ νόσος, but
without giving any further
explanation; on the contrary
in <i>Hesychius</i> we find: s. v.
φθινὰ[ς] ἡ ἐρυσίβη, καὶ
εἶδος ἐλαίας (under word
φθινὰ; the red blight, also
a species of olive). But by
ἐρυσίβη is signified <i>mildew</i>,
<i>blight</i>, <i>smut on grain</i>, the
same thing therefore as the
Romans called <i>rubigo</i> or
<i>robigo</i>, on which <i>Servius</i>,
on Virg. Georg. I. 151., has
the following observation:
Robigo genus est vitii, quo
culmi pereunt, quod a rusticanis
calamitas dicitur. Hoc autem
genus vitii ex nebula nasci
solet, cum <em class="gesperrt">nigrescunt et
consumuntur</em> frumenta.
Inde Robigus deus et sacra
eius septimo Kalendas Maias
Robigalia appellantur. Sed
<em class="gesperrt">haec abusive</em> robigo dicitur;
nam <i>proprie robigo
est</i>, ut Varro dicit, <em class="gesperrt">vitium
obscoenae libidinis
quod ulcus vocatur: id
autem abundantia et
superfluitate humoris</em>
solet nasci, quae Graece
σατυρίασις dicitur. (<i>Robigo</i>
is a sort of blight, that kills
the corn-stalks, which is spoken
of as a <i>disaster</i> by the peasants.
Now this kind of blight commonly
springs from a mist or
exhalation, the crops blackening
and being burnt up. Hence
the god Robigus, and his
feast-day on the seventh day
before the Kalends of May
(April 24.), known as the
Robigalia. But this is called
<i>robigo</i> only by a misnomer;
for properly speaking <i>robigo</i>
is, as Varro says, a vitiation
due to abominable licentiousness
and is called an ulcer,
and it commonly springs from
that abundance and over-copiousness
of the humour, which
in Greek is called Satyriasis).
These words are for our purpose
pose of the highest importance,
teaching us as they do, that
<i>a distinctive form of ulceration,
that the patient had
brought on himself by sexual
excesses, was not only familiar
among the Romans</i> but actually
bore the <i>special</i> name of
<i>robigo</i>. It must have displayed
a distinctive redness, and have
consumed the parts affected
similarly to the smut or rust
of grain, or the rust of iron.
It is surely a sufficient indication
to call the chancre-ulcer
a blight, a burning: Comp.
anthrax, carbo (malignant
pustule, carbuncle). To this
day in Germany it is vulgarly
said of any one attacked by
the primary forms of Venereal
disease, “the man has burned
himself”. <i>Festus</i>, (edit. Dacier
p. 451.) says: <i>Robum</i> rubro
colore et quae rufo significare,
at bovem quoque rustici appellant,
manifestum est, unde
et <i>materia quae plurimas
venas eius coloris habet</i> dicta
est rubor, (<i>Robus</i> clearly indicates
things of a red or
reddish colour,—now countrymen
even speak of an ox as
<i>robus</i>; hence <i>any substance
having manifold veins of this
colour</i> is called <i>rubor</i>). Now
such is habitually the case
with the penis attacked by
phimosis or paraphimosis and
under the morbid condition
of constant erection (Satyriasis)
superinduced by these. Again
this shows us the reason why
Priapus is so frequently called
“<i>ruber</i> hortorum custos” (the
<i>red</i> keeper of gardens),—<i>Priapeia</i>
Praef. 5.; and why
he is said, “<i>Ruber</i> sedere
cum <i>rubente</i> fascino,” (to sit,
<i>red</i> with his <i>ruddy</i> verge),—<i>Horace</i>,
Odes 84. Sat. I. 8. 5.
Now as the blight in grain was
regarded specially as a consequence
of the dew (mil<i>dew</i>),
and <i>ros</i> (dew) again is used
in the sense of the male semen,
as well as for the moisture
secreted in the female vagina
during coition, we might draw
yet another analogy from this,
and at the same time a proof
of the <i>verecundia loquentium</i>
(shamefacedness in speech),—p.
43., of the <i>old</i> Romans.
Thus it would seem the Greeks
too indicated by their φθινὰς
the same thing as the Romans
by <i>robigo</i>. That it was a
human disease, is clearly
enough shown by the passage
from Pollux, and besides we
can see it was so from another
in <i>Plutarch</i> in his Life of
Galba (ch. 21.), where he says:
Τιγελλῖνον μὲν οὐ πολὺν
ἔτι βιώσεσθαι φάσκοντος·
χρόνον, ὑπὸ <em class="gesperrt">φθινάδος
νόσου</em> δαπανώμενον, (For
he said that Tigellinus would
not live much longer, being exhausted
by a wasting disease),—a
quotation proving at the
same time the deadliness of
the malady. Once more, <i>Hesychius</i>
has for φθινὰ also
φοινία, saying, <em class="gesperrt">φοινία</em>.ἐρυσίβη
(φοινία: red blight,
and as the adjective corresponding
would necessarily be
φοινικίος or φοινίκινος, it
follows that φοινικίη νόσος
and φθινικὴ νόσος,—φθινικὴ
being the adjective
from φθινὴ or φθινὰς,
(which however would more
strictly speaking be φθινακή),
would mean exactly the same
thing, viz. an “Ulcus rubrum
et rodens ex coitu cum foeda
muliere natum” (red eating
ulcer, coming from coition
with an unclean woman), the
fatal event of which affection
was a matter of common observation
among the Ancients.
Now if this interpretation is
the right one in the passage
of Hippocrates, it is clear that
λεῦκαι were the consequences
of this malady, and accordingly
we should have a proof that
in Antiquity, no less than in
modern times, primary ulcers
not only preceded secondary
affections of the skin, but were
actually <i>recognized as such</i>.
However as the proofs for this
<i>aperçu</i> are still too fragmentary
on the side of the ancient
Physicians, we must suspend
our immediate judgement on
the point, and content ourselves
for the present with saying,
that φοινικίη νοῦσος stood
originally in the text in the
sense of <i>cunnilingere</i> (to be
a <i>cunnilingue</i>), whereas a
later inquirer put φθινικὴ
into its place, inasmuch as in
his time their meanings had
become identical as that of a
bodily ailment, and so <i>the
consequence</i> of the vice instead
of the vice itself found its
way even into the text. For
granted φθινὰς has the meaning
of <i>robigo</i> (blight), there
is no doubt this only came
to be the case as late as in the
time of the Alexandrine critics.
Besides this, φοινικιστὴς is
also found in the <i>Etymologicum
Magnum</i> for <i>Cunnilingus</i>;
we read: γλωττοκομεῖον,
ἐν ᾧ οἱ αὐληταὶ
ἀπετίθεσαν τὰς γλώττας·
εἴρηται δὲ καὶ τὸ <em class="gesperrt">γυναικεῖον
αἰδοῖον</em> ὑπὸ Εὐβούλου
<em class="gesperrt">φοινικιστὴν</em>
σκώπτοντος· (γλωττοκομεῖον,
tongue-hole, place in which
fluteplayers insert their tongues);
<i>the female privates</i> also called
so by Eubulus, making a scoff
at the φοινικιστὴς,—<i>cunnilingue</i>).
The <i>Etymologicum
Magnum</i> further has as
synonyms for <i>cunnilingere</i>:
<em class="gesperrt">γλωττοστροφεῖν</em>, περιλαλεῖν
καὶ στωμύλλεσθαι·
<em class="gesperrt">γλωττοδεψεῖν</em>, αἰσχρουργεῖν
(<i>to ply the tongue</i>:
to talk excessively, to babble;
<i>to work or soften with the
tongue</i>: to do obscenely), and

στόμαργον (<i>tongue-busy</i>:

(But in the case of <i>lichenes</i>,
scabs, on the chin the malady
is most troublesome. Now it
brings on itchings and a critical
condition of the afflicted and
no small danger; for it creeps
sometimes over the whole
face, and <i>attacks the eyes</i>,
and generally is productive of
the <i>most utter disfigurement</i>.
Wherefore physicians should
devote more than ordinary
care to its treatment, watching
<i>the crises of the malady, and
the intervals, and judging
from the symptoms that have
become chronic such as have
but just broken out</i>, on the
appearance of which it will
be expedient to exhibit siccative
medicines. On the other
hand when <i>it has resolved
itself into the itch or leprosy</i>,
exhibit cathartics in combination
with the siccatives). The
same is contributed also by
<i>Aëtius</i>, Tetrab. II. serm. 4.
ch. 16. Besides the discrepant
statement to the effect that
the eyes are attacked as well,
the most noteworthy points
are the crises and intervals

its passing over into Psora

a harlot); the same occur also
in <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>,
loco citato ch. 10. Finally
yet another quotation, from
<i>Martial</i> (XI. 59.), should come
in here; he says to a pathic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">At tibi nil faciam: sed lota mentula laeva</div>
  <div class="verse">λειχάζειν cupidae dicet avaritiae,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(But to <i>you</i> I will do no harm;
nay! rather shall my member,
when your left hand has done
its work and been washed,
say to your grasping avarice,—now
lick, fellate, me). This
passage has been misunderstood
by most of the commentators,
because they chose to
read <i>lana</i> (woollen cloth) for
<i>laeva</i> (the left hand), or else
thought to find here a reference
to manustupration (masturbation
with the hand). But really
it means nothing more than
that the poet declares he will
resort to <i>irrumation</i>, after his
mentula (member) has been
washed with the left hand,
[the Latin cannot mean this;
<i>lotā</i> is ablative case, and must
be taken with <i>laevā</i>. <i>Transl.</i>],—a
usage to which we shall
come back again subsequently;
but which is at once clearly
authenticated by a fragment of
<i>Lucilius</i>, where we read:</p>

<i>Jöhrens</i>, in his Dissertation

on the subject (p. 47): “De
feminis, cum suavia maritorum
evitare nequiverint, quomodo
ab ista infectione liberae
evaserint, maius restat dubium:
nos opinamur, cum viri barbam
saepius radi soliti fuerint, ea

women, when they have been
unable to avoid the caresses
of husbands, it remains very
doubtful how they have got
off free from this infection.
Our own opinion is that as
men have always been accustomed
to have the beard
shaved frequently, for this
reason the pores being opened
more widely by the action of
the razor, that virulent ferment
and active poison creeps in
more easily and produces its
characteristic effect. On the
other hand women being
beardless, the baldness of the
skin offering an obstacle and
the <i>pores being less open</i>,
have been able to escape).</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_106_106" href="#FNanchor_106_106" class="label">106</a>
However this did happen
in isolated cases, as is shown
by the example of Philaenis,
who indeed was a Tribad
properly, in <i>Martial</i>, bk. VII.
Epigr. 67.,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

a <i>manly</i> vice to act the cunnilingue).
Comp. bk. IV.
Epigr. 41. But it was always
a very exceptional thing to
find this vice practised among
women; in fact <i>Juvenal</i>, Sat.

It is a surprising circumstance
that the words <i>basium</i>,
<i>basiare</i>, <i>basiator</i> (kiss, to kiss,
kisser) appear only to have
come into use by the Romans
from the time of Catullus
onwards, and are found almost
exclusively in Martial, Juvenal
and the still later Petronius,
so coinciding with a period in
which dissoluteness of morals
had reached the highest pitch
among the Romans. Some
would derive the word <i>basium</i>
from βάζω, loqui, (to speak);
so perhaps it may have been
used in a similar way to
narrare (to tell) in <i>Martial</i>
(III. 84.) in the sense of
<i>cunnilingere</i>. Βάζω, βαίνω,
βεινῶ and βινῶ (to speak, to
go, to have sexual intercourse)
seem all to have one and the
same stem. The second of the
two Epigrams of <i>Martial</i>
quoted in the text reminds us
almost involuntarily of the first
Tarsica of Chrysostom. Apparently
<i>basium</i> and <i>basiare</i>
always imply a <i>vicious kiss</i>,
to <i>kiss viciously</i>, in a general
way. Hence <i>Martial</i>, XI. 62.,
Mediumque mavult basiare
quam summum, (And she had
rather kiss his middle than
his head). <i>Petronius</i>, Sat.,
Ultime cinaedus supervenit,—extortis
nos clunibus cecidit,
modo basiis olidissimis inquinavit.
(Finally a <i>cinaedus</i>
appeared,—he made at us with
writhing buttocks, and anon
befouled us with most evil-smelling
kisses).</p></div>

<i>Luxus</i> in the sense of
sexual excess occurs not unfrequently
in ancient writers,
e.g. in <i>Tacitus</i>, Hist. IV. 14.,
<i>Suetonius</i>, Nero 29. <i>Capua

worth noting that <i>Paracelsus</i>

disease; he says, De causis
et origine luis Gallicae, (Of
the Causes and Origin of the
French Contagion), bk. I. ch. 5.:
<em class="gesperrt">Luxus</em> autem nomen quod

being taken from the influencing
circumstance or efficient

irritation or tickling of the seed,
leading to the performance of
the Venereal act and caused
by diseases latent in the body,
and so a strong motion of
love being made in consequence
of the disease in the act itself,
then from the common expression

The Scholiast <i>Acro</i> even
in his time says on this passage:
Campanum in morbum.
Aut oris foeditatem aut arrogantiam.
Dicuntur enim Campani
foedi osse, arrogantes.
Sic foeda accipiamus. Aliter,
Campani, qui et Osci dicebantur
ore immundi. Unde etiam
Oscenos dicimus. (As to the
Campanian disease, this is
either foulness of mouth, or
arrogance. For the Campanians
are said to be foul, arrogant.
So let us take it as foul. In
another sense, the Campanians,
who were also called Oscans
are filthy of mouth. For which
reason we say <i>Osceni</i>—obscene).
<i>Lambinus</i> expresses himself
yet more distinctly: Campani,
qui antea Osci dicebantur,
habiti sunt ore impuro atque
incesto; τοῦτ’ ἔστι τῷ στόματι
αἰσχροποιοῦντες καὶ λεσβιάζοντες, morbum igitur animi
intellige, ut Od. I. 37. (The
Campanians, who were previously called Oscans, were
considered of impure and
abominable mouth; that is to
say as acting uncleanly with the
mouth or <i>Lesbianizing</i>; understand
therefore a mental disease,
as in Od. I. 37.). The Latin
<i>Morbus</i> is frequently so used.</p></div>

Besides Acro, <i>Florus

on Aristophanes’Wasps v.
1337., referred the morbus
Campanus to <i>fellation</i>, saying,
Hac detestanda libidine iuxta

sive Nolani, ut ex
Ausonio et Horatio patet,
quorum testimonia non arcessam,

putant: In triclinio Coa, in

hanc Lesbiam et Campanam
foeditatem. (This hateful form
of lust was practised by the
<i>Campanians</i> or Nolans, as
well as by the Lesbians, as is
manifest from what Ausonius
and Horace say,—whose evidence
however I will not quote,
this ground being already preoccupied
by more learned
writers. This much only will
I add, viz. the riddle that was
directed against the wife of
Metellus Clodius: “On the
banquet-couch a Coan, in the
bed-chamber a Nolan,” and
which is thought to allude to
this Lesbian and Campanian
abomination). The riddle is
found in <i>Quintilian</i>, Instit.
Orat. VIII. 6.; but is differently explained in Forberg,
loco citato p. 283. He says:
<i>Coam</i> dici, quod voluerit in
triclinio coire, <i>Nolam</i>, quod
noluerit in cubiculo, (that she
was called a <i>Coan</i>, because
willing to have intercourse on
the banquet-couch, a Nolan,
because unwilling to do so in
the bed-chamber), that is to
say, Clodia would satisfy her
lust only publicly, not in

(Voyage dans l’Amérique

in North America,
etc., transl. from the English,
Yverdun 1784., pp. 355 sqq.)
and Crêve-Cœur (Lettres du
Cultivateur Américain,—Letters
from an American Farmer,
Vol. III. p. 48), the bite of
the rattle-snake would appear
to call up on the skin of the
person bitten, each recurrent
year, marks resembling the
hue of the snake. Comp. <i>C.
W. Stark</i>, “Allgem. Pathologie”
(General Pathology),
Leipzig 1838. p. 364. Perhaps
too the expression κίναδος
belongs in this connection, of
which the Scholiast on Aristophanes,
Clouds 447., says,
εἶδός τι θηρίου.—κακοῦργος
οὖν, φησὶν, ὡς ἀλώπηξ,
τινὲς δὲ κίναδος ζῶον μικρὸν
<em class="gesperrt">τὸ αἰδοῖον εἰςσωθοῦν
καὶ ἐξωθοῦν</em>. (a kind of
beast,—mischievous, they say,
as a fox, but others say κίναδος
means a little animal that
<i>forces its way in and out of
the privates</i>). Suidas brings
forward the same statement,
under the word κίναδος.
From the connection in which
<i>Democritus</i> mentions it in
Stobaeus’Sermon. 42., περὶ
κιναδέων τε καὶ ἑρπετέων
(Of κίναδοι and Creeping
Things), <i>Schmeider</i> in his
Lexicon supposes it to signify
<i>snakes</i> particularly. Again
<i>Schnieder</i>, Arrian’s Indica

(a snake). The close resemblance
with κίναιδος (Cinaedus)
is striking.</p></div>

surprising that the menstrual
blood, remaining for a time

is from Asia that the opinion

by the Arab physicians to
those of Europe. No doubt
in very hot climates, if dirty
habits be added to the extreme
heat of the atmosphere, there
is nothing at all unlikely in
the blood, retained as it is
in a hot locality, in close
proximity to the faeces in the
bowels, growing sour and
smelling foul.... <i>A certain
viscous quality may very well

That is to say so far as
it is suffered to remain for any
length of time in the vagina
and comes more or less in
contact with the atmospheric
air; for in the case of healthy
menstrual blood no injurious
combination is set up at all or
any foul acridity developed, as
<i>John Stedman</i> (Physiolog.
Versuche und Beobachtungen,—Physiological
Investigations
and Observations, transl. from
the English, Leipzig 1778.
8vo., pp. 50-54.) long ago
maintained. It is more probable
however that any slight putrefactive
action occurring is in
each case due not so much
to this as to the <i>acid quality</i>
of the menstrual blood, which
in conjunction with the acid
vaginal mucus undergoes a
kind of acetous fermentation
in the vagina, the product of
which has thus a corrosive
effect. <i>Retzius</i> indeed has lately
not only found menstrual blood
to possess an exceedingly acid
reaction, but even proved that
it contains free phosphoric and
lactic acids. Comp. Arsberättelse

Hence too <i>Hugo Grotius</i>
writes (Commentar. ad Mosis
lib. III.—Commentary on
Book of Leviticus, ch. 15.):
Sciendum est autem in Syria
et locis vicinis non minus τὴν
γονόῤῥοιαν quam τὰ ἐμμήνια
habere aliquid contagione
nocens, (But it is to be observed
that in Syria and the neighbouring
regions ἡ γονοῤῥοία
(discharge from the genitals)
no less than τὰ ἐμμήνια
(menstrual discharge) contains
a principle contagiously injurious).
Even <i>Astruc</i>, the
eager advocate of the American
origin of Venereal disease, says
(Vol. I. p. 92.): Sane constat in
hac nostra Europa, quae magis
temperata est, si cum menstruatis
res habeatur, balanum
et praeputium leviore phlogosi
aut superficiariis pustulis, quae
tamen brevi cessant, <em class="gesperrt">plerumque</em>
affici. Quanto graviora
ergo iis impendere credendum
est, quos in calidiore et aestuante
climate misceri cum foeminis
non pudet, dum illis
menses actu fluunt natura
acerrimi et quasi virosi. Ideo
forsan factum est, ut medici
Arabes, qui regiones calidiores
incolebant, quam Graeci et
Latini, et primi et saepe disseruerint
de pustulis et ulceribus
virgae, oriundis ex coitu
cum foeda muliere, hoc est (?),
cum muliere menstruata. (It is
an undoubted fact that in this
Europe of ours, though enjoying
a more temperate climate,
if intercourse is had with
women during menstruation,
the <i>glans penis</i> and prepuce
are <i>generally</i> attacked by
some little inflammation or by
superficial pustules, which however
soon disappear. What
much more serious consequences
then must we suppose
threaten those who in a warmer
climate, one steaming with
heat, are not ashamed to make
coition with women, whilst
their <i>menses</i> are actually flowing,
these being from the nature
of the case exceedingly acrid
and almost poisonous. Perhaps
this is why the Arab physicians,
who lived in warmer
countries than the Greek and
Latin practitioners, first and
most often treated of pustules
and ulcers of the verge, arising
from coition with an unclean
woman, that is to say (?) with
a woman during menstruation).

(for translation see text above).
For κατὰ <em class="gesperrt">τινὰ</em> οἰκονομίαν
(by a certain providence) we
ought probably to read κατὰ
<span class="em">θινὰν</span> or <em class="gesperrt">θείαν</em> οἰκονομίαν,
a collocation of words
constantly found in Palladius,
and occurring in this very
chapter a few lines before, in
the sense of “by Divine
providence”. On the other
hand the words τὰ πρὸς τὸ
ἕλκος ἑαυτοῦ διελέγετο are
to us absolutely unintelligible.
<i>Helvetius</i> translates the passage:
Incidit in coenum femineae
cupiditatis et cum peccare
constituisset cum quadam mima
assidue colloquutus, <i>ulcus
suum aperuit</i>, (He fell into
the mire of lust after women,
and having set his mind on
sinning, constantly conversing
with a certain actress, <i>he
opened his sore</i>. Indeed the
γυναικείη ἐπιθυμία (womanly
lust) itself is ambiguous,
as strictly speaking it points
to something unmanly, and
if we compare with it the
γυναικεία νοῦσος (womanly
disease) of Dio Chrysostom
(p. 209.), our thoughts cannot
but turn to the vice of the
pathic,—which however Hero
could not very well practise
with an actress, and to which he
could hardly owe an <i>anthrax</i>
on the <i>glans penis</i>. But ch.
35. shows us plainly enough
that <i>Palladius</i> in using the
phrase means lust, indulgence
with women, accomplishing
coition. It is related in that
chapter of the Abbot Elias,
how he had founded a nunnery,
and was thereupon assailed by
violent desire to abuse the
nuns; wherefore he prayed,
ἀπόκτεινόν με, ἵνα μὴ ἴδω
αὐτὰς θλιβομένας. ἢ <em class="gesperrt">τὸ
πάθος</em> μου λάβε, ἵνα
αὐτῶν φροντίζω κατὰ λόγον.
(Kill me, that I may not see
them troubled, or else take
away my <i>passion</i>, that I may
look upon them with reason
and moderation). Thereafter
he fell asleep and dreamed
the angels had castrated him,
and on waking found indeed
that he still possessed his
genitals, but he declared, ὅτι
οὐκέτι ἀνέβη εἰς τὴν καρδίαν
μου πάθος <em class="gesperrt">γυναικὸς
ἐπιθυμίας</em>. (there no
more entered into my heart
the passion of <i>lust after</i>
women). But now what does
τὰ πρὸς τὸ ἕλκος mean?
Guided by the general sense,
we might take it as meaning
the genital organs, though we
have searched in vain for
analogous passages. But in
that case it could be made to
apply only to the female genitals
or to the rectum, because
these only exhibit a breach of
continuity (ἕλκος,—a wound);
or else we should have to
suppose the seed to be looked
upon in a sort of way as
matter discharged, and the
male genitals, which secrete
it, therefore called ἕλκος (a
wound), for otherwise the
ἑαυτοῦ (his own) cannot be
got in. No less uncertain is
the meaning of διελέγετο;
“to converse” cannot possibly
be taken as the sense here.
<i>Suidas</i> and <i>Hesychius</i> explain
διαλέγεσθαι by συνουσιάζειν
(to associate with). <i>Pollux</i>,
Onomast. V. 93. περὶ μίξεως
ζώων (On the intercourse of
Animals) says, διαλεχθῆναι.—οὐδ’
ἡ διάλεξις, ἀλλὰ
διειλέχθην αὐτῇ καὶ διειλεγμένος
εἰμὶ ὡς Ὑπερίδης. II.
125. Ὑπερίδης δὲ διειλεγμένος,
ἐπ’ἀφροδισίων. Ἀριστοφάνης
δὲ διαλέξασθαι ἔφη.
(διελεχθῆναι,—not ordinary
conversation, but it means “I
had converse with her”, or
“I am conversant”, as says
Hyperides, II. 125. Now
Hyperides says “conversant
with”, speaking of love intercourse;
and Aristophanes “to
have converse with”). Comp.
Küster and Brunck on Aristophanes’
Plut. 1083. Moeris
p. 131. Abresch, lect. Aristaenet.
p. 50. But the meaning
of accomplishing coition is
implied already in προσομιλῶν
(associating with), so that
διαλέγεσθαι must here indicate
some other more special
circumstance. The Scholiast of
Aristophanes on Lys. 720
interprets διαλέγουσιν by
διορύττουσιν (bore through),
penetrate); accordingly we
must take διαλέγεσθαι as
deponent, in which case we
should have to read τὰ πρὸς
τὸ ἕλκος <em class="gesperrt">αὐτῆς</em> διελέγετο
(he penetrated <i>her</i> private
parts), and make the τὰ πρὸς
ἕλκος refer to the actress and
her hymen (or fibula?), just
as in the passage cited from
Josephus on p. 315. the expression
περὶ τὸ αἰδοῖον
(about the privates) signifies
the foreskin. If we would keep
ἑαυτοῦ (his own), then we
must take διαλέγομαι in the
sense of καθαίρειν (to purify)
(Hesychius says διαλέγειν,
ἀνακαθαίρειν,—to purify),
and put in an οὐκ (not),—i.e.
he did not purify his genitals.
If we keep to the meaning
of separation, division, we
might understand the sentence
as saying that Hero tore apart
his foreskin; though really ἕλκος
could scarcely be applied with
any propriety to the male
genitals at all. For its being
used of the female genitals on
the other hand a good analogy
is offered by ἐσχάρα (a scab),
which occurs in Aristophanes,
Knights 1286. and often elsewhere.
Eustathius, on Odyss.
p. 1523., says: δῆλον δ’ὅτι
ἐσχάραν καὶ τὸ γυναικεῖον
ἐκάλουν μόριον. (Now it is
evident they used to call the
female part ἐσχάρα). However
in this case the learned reader
must be left to decide for
himself.]</p>

It is true <i>Maimonides</i> according
to <i>Selden</i>, Uxor Hebraica

1673. 4to., p. 133., says:
At vero si esset mensibus

(But indeed if she

the marriage was not proceeded
with)—but in that case of
course it happened unwittingly;
though no doubt it may very
well on the other hand have
been done not unfrequently
wittingly. <i>Festus</i> explains the
Latin word <i>imbubinare</i> by
“menstruo mulierum sanguine
inquinare” (to pollute with the
menstrual blood of women),
which might almost justify us
in conjecturing, that <i>buboes</i>
had been observed to originate
from intercourse with women
during menstruation. <i>Hippocrates</i>,

<i>Leviticus</i> Ch. 15. Want
of space forbids our giving this
Chapter here; but anyone who
will read it through carefully,
must easily see that in it the
question is merely of a morbid
discharge from the genitals
(basar), the duration of which
was uncertain. For this reason
those affected continued still
unclean for nine days after the
cessation of the flux, whereas
the man who had encountered
ordinary pollution (verse 16.)
was unclean only till the
evening. The Septuagint translators
render the flux by ῥύσις
(flowing, flux), the person affected
by the flux γονοῤῥυής
(having a flux from the genitals),
while they say of ordinary
pollution, ὡς ἐὰν ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ
αὐτοῦ κοίτη <em class="gesperrt">σπέρματος</em>
(“if any man’s seed of copulation
go out of him”). <i>Astruc</i>
and others wished to refer the
flux from the genitals to Lepra
(Leprosy), but in that case the
Leprosy must needs have been
previously noticeable in the
person affected by the flux,
and the flux therefore been
really a symptom. Thus it
would have demanded no
further special ordinance for
purification, as that commanded
for Leprosy would have been
used for it. Again the same
would also have occurred, had
the flux been noticed as <i>first</i>
symptom of the Leprosy, for
then the Priest was bound to
have confined the person so
affected and put him under
observation, to see whether
the other symptoms of Leprosy
would show themselves as
well. But of this there is
nothing whatever to be found
in the writings attributed to
Moses, who clearly distinguishes
between the flux and
Leprosy, as also does the
Author of II Samuel III. 29.
Speaking generally, no other
Author ever mentions the flux
as a constant or frequent
symptom of Leprosy, while
<i>Schilling</i> even denies its occurrence
altogether. Comp.

plain the same heat of the

identical in its nature and one

still live after the same fashion).

Pendant le travail de la suppuration,
les blessés furent
seulement incommodés des
vers ou larves de la mouche
bleue, commune en Syrie.
L’incubation des oeufs que
cette mouche deposait sans
cesse dans les plaies ou dans
les appareils, étoit favorisée
par la chaleur de la saison,
l’humidité de l’atmosphère et
la qualité de la toile à pansement
(elle étoit de coton) la
seule qu’on ait pu se procurer
dans cette contrée. La présence
de ces vers dans les plaies
paraissait en accélérer la suppuration,
causait des demangeaisons
incommodes aux
blessés et nous forçait de les
panser trois ou quatre fois le
jour. Ces insectes, formés en
quelques heures, se développaient
avec une telle rapidité,
que du jour au lendemain, ils
étaient de la grosseur d’un
tuyau de plume de poulet. On
faisait à chaque pansement des
lotions d’une forte décoction
de rhue et de petite sauge, qui
suffisaient pour les détruire;
mais ils se reproduisaient
bientot après par le défaut
des moyens propres à écarter
l’approche des mouches et à
prévenir l’incubation de leurs
oeufs. (During the action of
suppuration, the only inconvenience
the wounded met
with was from the worms or
larvae of the blue fly, common
in Syria. The hatching of the
eggs, which this fly was continually
depositing in the
wounds or their dressings,
was favoured by the heat of
the season, the moisture of
the atmosphere, and the nature
of the material used for bandages.
This was cotton, the
only material for the purpose
that could be procured in that
country. The presence of these
worms in the wounds appeared
to accelerate their suppuration,
caused the wounded men to
suffer from troublesome itchings
and forced us to renew
the dressings three or four
times a day. These insects,
formed in a few hours, developed
with such extraordinary
rapidity, that from one day
to the next, they reached the
size of a fowl’s quill. At each
dressing lotions were applied
of a strong decoction of rue
and dwarf sage, which was
effectual in destroying them;
but they reappeared again very
soon afterwards owing to the
want of proper means for
preventing the approach of the
flies and hindering the hatching
of their eggs). Compare what
Larrey (p. 278.) says as to
the climate of Syria.</p></div>

recall the passions and abominations
of the man? or to
count the multitude of debaucheries
done by him? Nay,
he could not pass through a
city without leaving behind
him everywhere ruin of women
and rape of virgins.—ch. 16.
Yet heaven-sent punishment
overtakes him, commencing
with his very flesh and going
on to assail the life. For an
incessant suppurative inflammation
attacks him in the region
of the private parts of the body;
then later on a wound penetrating
deep in like a fistula
and an incurable eating sore
affecting these inmost intestines.
Then from these an
indescribable number of worms
bred, and a corpse-like smell
was given off, the whole bulk
of the bodily parts having
through high living and under
the influence of the disease
changed into an exaggerated
superfluity of fat. Then this
rotting away, displayed an
intolerable and an appalling
spectacle to his attendants;
while among his physicians,
some finding themselves utterly
unable to endure the exceeding
horribleness of the stench, put
an end to their lives; while
others, the whole bulk having
gone to complete rottenness,
and the patient in a condition
that admitted no hope of
recovery, being unable to afford
any help, were cruelly put to
death). This passage occurs as
well, word for word, in

Already we find <i>Lorry</i>,
“Abb. von den Krankheiten
der Haut,” (Treatise on Diseases
of the Skin), Vol. I. p.
50., saying: “There is found
to exist moreover a certain
sympathy between the generative
parts of men and women
and the skin, which under the
violent stimulus of sexual coition
swells; but after it is over,
sweat comes out on it, and
<i>sometimes little heat-pimples
appear</i>. p. 83., Now at
puberty, a period when all the
glands are opened, there is
brought to the organs of transpiration
a great quantity of
a subtle and fluid material,
there arises a peculiar smell,
and if this matter has accumulated,
it clogs the minute
vessels, the humour contained
in these becomes thick by
retardation and solidification,—the
result being a pimply
eruption on the skin. This
much is certain, that if both
sexes are fully developed, and
live chaste, an extensive series
of mutually connected pustules
may arise, <i>just as if they
were produced by the swelling
of the glands in the skin</i>.
The pustules are ranged in
the same order as that in
which the glands lie; exactly
as if they were the meeting-place
of the humours that
would seem to have been
dispersed in the skin.” Comp.

<i>Alex. Traj. Petronius</i>,
De morbo Gallico, (On the
French Disease—Syphilis), bk.
II. chs. 24., and 26 (Aphrodisiacus
pp. 1225, 1226.) in
his time says: Et in regione
calida, quoniam secundum
naturae suae impetum ad cutem
fertur, minus saevire, in frigida
vero, quoniam contra suam
naturam ad interna migrare
cogitur, magis.—Neque nos
non lateat, in ambiente (ut
dicunt) calido, quoniam ad
cutim attractio fit, morbum
hunc et secundum naturae suae
impetum creari, et simul ad
exteriora prorumpere solere.
In frigido autem, quia intro
repellitur contra suae naturae
motum retroverti et solidas
corporis partes saepius depasci.
Frequentius etiam in regione
calida quam frigida apparere;
hic enim circumfusus aer, ne
morbus ad cutim extendatur,
prohibet (nam intro pellit), illic
vero et ad cutim trahit et
eandem retinet. (Moreover in
a hot region, inasmuch as in
accordance with the impulse
of its nature it is carried to
the skin, it is there less virulent;
whereas in a cold one,
as it is compelled against its
nature to travel to the inward
parts, it is more so.—Again
we should not let this escape
our notice, that in a hot environment
(as they say), inasmuch
as an attraction takes place
towards the skin, this disease
also according to the impulse
of its nature is there brought
into being, and is wont to
break out towards the external
parts. On the other hand
in a cold one, because it is
drawn within, it is turned
back contrary to the motion
of its nature, and more often
feeds upon the solid parts of
the body. Again it appears
more frequently in a hot region
than in a cold one; for in the
latter case the surrounding air
(driving it within as it does)
hinders the disease from extending
to the skin, whereas
in the former it draws it to
the skin and keeps it there).
But specially pertinent in this
connection is p. 1211.—<i>Puydebat</i>,
“Über den Einfluss
des Climas auf den Menschen,”
(Of the Influence of Climate
on Man), in the “Bulletin
méd. de Bordeaux, 1836. May
21. (Froriep Notiz. 1836. Vol.
49. p. 179.) writes: Die immer
geöffneten Hautporen hauchen
in den heissen Ländern einen
reichlichen, mehr oder weniger
stark riechenden Schweiss aus.
Die Hautdrüsen sondern eine
ölige Flüssigkeit in Menge
ab, welche die Haut schlüpfrig
macht und derselben jenes bei
den Negern so auffallende
Ansehn giebt. Dieser Zustand
der Haut macht sie zu
Exanthemen, z. B. Masern,
Blattern, Syphilis, Lepra,
Elephantiasis geneigt. (The
ever open skin-pores expire in
hot countries a rich and more
or less strongly smelling sweat.
The cutaneous glands secrete
an oily fluid in quantities,
which makes the skin slippery
and gives it that appearance
so striking in Negroes. This
state of the skin makes it liable
to exanthematic effections, e.g.
Measles, Small-pox, Syphilis,
Leprosy, Elephantiasis).—In
cold countries the transpiration
of the skin is very weak; in
consequence the internal secretions
are increased in quantity,
while in hot countries they
are lessened from a directly
opposite cause.” Comp. <i>J. von

(Travels in Africa, Egypt and

by C. Sprengel. Weimar 1800.
8vo., p. 389., tells us of a
marine at Kahira, who had
become infected, how the man,
having in the mean time taken
no means whatever to combat
the disease and without giving
up either the use of brandy
or the practice of copulation,
two months later got a violent
itching eruption over his whole
body, and particularly on the
head and over the glands of
the neck. This he treated by
sprinkling over it a sort of red
earth, whereupon it dried up
and disappeared, so that four
weeks later he found himself
completely cured and his skin
as clean and smooth as before.

Mussulman in the East is
strictly forbidden to cohabit
with a woman before the
eighth day after her purification.
If it <i>is</i> done within that
period, the man’s body is
poisoned: he experiences swelling,
ulcers, sores, itch and
pains in the limbs, and shows
all the symptoms of leprosy.
At this time the female does
not become pregnant, because
the blood is unclean, but if
conception does occur, the
child also gets a bad itch, and
generally is affected like his
parents.” <i>Fr. Eagle</i> (Lancet

1. ch. 122., Novimus quosdam
audaciores qui sibi ipsis testes
ferro resecarunt; castratis enim
non in peius malum ipsum
procedet. Neque enim temere
reperias, inquit Archigenes,
ullum aliquem castratum elephantiasi
laborantem, neque
item facile mulierem. Quare
etiam quidam ex confidentioribus
medicis manum admoverunt,
et quotquot sane ex

(We know of some bolder
spirits who have amputated
their own testicles with the
knife; for after castration the
actual evil will not then
proceed to any worse length.
For, says Archigenes, you will
not readily find any single case
of a castrated man suffering
from elephantiasis, nor will
you easily discover a woman
at all affected by this disease.
Wherefore, in fact, some of
the more daring practitioners
have operated, and there is no
doubt that such of their patients
as escaped the dangerous effects
of the operation, have
been through the employment
of subsequent precautions completely
freed from this malignant
complaint). Comp. <i>Hensler</i>,
“Vom Aussatz”, (On
Leprosy), p. 401. With regard
to <i>the immunity of women</i>,
an assertion likewise made in
connection with <i>mentagra</i>
(p. 288), <i>von Roeser</i> writes
(loco citato p. 67.) referring
to Venereal disease: “Above
all it is now the case in Greece
and Turkey that the practising
physician,—and I have been
assured of the fact by many
persons,—exceedingly seldom
meets with syphilitic female
patients in his practice; that
yet notwithstanding this none
of <i>the sequelæ and different
forms of subsequent mischief</i>
that are usually found resulting
from the disease when every
kind of medical aid is neglected,
are seen in patients of that
sex.”—P. 71., “Only poison
would seem, as a result of
the secretive process exerted
by the affected parts of the
skin and the mucous membrane,
which is much more powerful
in women than in men, to be
more readily eliminated from
the body than is the case
with men, so much so indeed
that it is an almost unheard
of thing in Egypt to find a
female patient under medical
treatment.”—still this does
not justify the conclusion that
women <i>never</i> suffered from
Venereal disease, as even von
Roeser himself admits. Again
Larrey, loco citato p. 253.,
actually found himself constrained
in view of the wide dissemination
of the disease among
the French soldiers, to establish
a special hospital for infected
women, in order to check the
spread of the complaint.</p></div>

The passage of <i>Aretaeus</i>
(Morb. chron. bk. II. ch. 13.
edit. Kühn p. 180.) can hardly
be cited as evidence on the
other side in this case, as
the question there discussed is
elephantiasis, not the leprosy
of the Jews at all. Any how
we read there: τρίχες ἐν μὲν
τῷ παντὶ προτεθνήσκουσι,
χερσὶ μηροῖσι κνήμῃσι, αὖθις
ἥβῃ, γενείοισι ἀραιαὶ, ψεδναὶ

ἀπρεπέστεραι τῶν ἀποιχομένων.
(Hair dies first in
every part, on hands, thighs,
shins; again on pubes and
cheeks it becomes thin, and
scanty also on the head. The
locks are prematurely white,
and baldness becomes general;
nor is it long before pubes
and cheeks are bare, and if
a few scanty hairs should
remain, they are uncomely as
compared with those that have
disappeared). Nor would it be
any fairer to cite the fact that
Albinos are covered over the
whole body with a fine, white,
woolly hair.</p></div>

makes Euelpides say: βδελλύττομαι
τὸν Λέπρεον ἀπὸ
Μελανθίου (I detest the
“Leprean” of Melanthius), on
which the Scholiast remarks:
Μελάνθιος ὁ τραγικός·
κωμωδεῖται γὰρ εἰς μαλακίαν
καὶ ὀψοφαγίαν. Πλάτων δὲ
αὐτὸν ἐν Σκύθαις ὡς <em class="gesperrt">λάλον</em>
σκώπτει· εἶχε δὲ Μελάνθιος
λέπραν. (Melanthius the
Tragedian; for he is derided
on account of his luxurious
living and gluttony. But Plato
laughs at him in the “Scythians”
as a <i>garrulous</i> person;
now Melanthius had <i>leprosy</i>).
The same thing is mentioned
in the “Peace”, 803., with
the addition, καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον
ἐν Κόλαξιν Εὔπολις ὡς
κίναιδον αὐτὸν διαβάλλει
καὶ κόλακα· ἀλλὰ καὶ ὡς
λευκὰς ἔχοντα καὶ λεπράς.
(and still more severely does
Eupolis in his “Flatterers”
ridicule him as being <i>pathic</i>
and a flatterer; moreover as
having whites,—white leprosies,—and
leprosies). Here we
would particularly call attention
to the λευκαί (white
leprosies), which we have
already noted as a consequence
of the habits of
the <i>cunnilingue</i>; and with
this the λάλον (garrulous,
talkative) of the Comic poet
Plato agrees very well, for
<i>Hesychius</i> explains γλωσσοστροφεῖν
(to ply the tongue)
by <em class="gesperrt">περιλαλεῖν</em> and
στωμύλλεσθαι (<i>to be very
talkative, to babble</i>). Thus
<i>lepra</i> would seem to be
attached as penalty to the vice
of the pathic, Elephantiasis
is stated to be infectious by
<i>Aretaeus</i>, Morb. chron., II.
12. and <i>Paulus Aegineta</i>,
IV. 1.; however, present day
experience tells us nothing
of this, and the later Greek
physicians refer it again to
deficient gall (Marx, Orig.

the meaning of its great
contagiousness in earlier times?</p></div>

of every observer that
in the case of abscesses that
have been set up in the urinary
canal in the region of the
privates,—called the urethra,—relief
is afforded when once
these have burst. For it is
likely some retention of urine
occurs on account of such
abscess, and so the fact of this
abscess having burst will obviously
remedy the retention).

(It offered a more terrifying
appearance where the parts
about the head were affected,
because even if only a small
deviation occur there from
what is normal, the feeling
of disgust experienced is
greater than in connection
with other parts of the body,
even when showing a great
divergence towards what is
abnormal. For the fact of the
skin of the thigh being perished,
or even when showing
of the upper arm, or of the
leg, or fore-arm, affords a less
formidable appearance, but if
the hair fall from the head
and the skin along with it,
and still more if that of the
cheeks and chin go with it,
the appearance of injury is
very great; but the danger is
all the while really less than
if the like were to happen
to the private parts or larynx
and thorax or any of the vital
parts. And not only are such
things when they happen to
the head more terrifying than
actually dangerous, but also
when it so falls out with
regard to any other part; for
much more dangerous is the
case of those in whom the
humour that sets up erysipelas
has penetrated deeply in, etc.).</p></div>

Very possibly in many

owed their existence to <i>anthrax</i>
or <i>carbuncle</i>; for not
only does <i>Hippocrates</i> (p.

πολλοὶ κατὰ θέρος καὶ ἄλλα
ἃ σὴψ καλέεται (many cases
of malignant pustule in Summer-time,
as well as other
complaints known under the
general name of putrefaction)
appeared under these meteorological
conditions, but <i>Galen</i>
likewise (Method. med. bk.
XIV., edit. Kühn Vol. X.
p. 980.) observed an <i>anthrax</i>
epidemic in Asia, that itself
began with numerous <i>phlyctaenae</i>
(blisterous swellings)
resembling millet seeds; these
subsequently broke and gave
rise to an ἕλκος ἐσχαρῶδες
(scabby sore). Indeed the
destruction of the skin took
place even without the previous
occurrence of <i>phlyctaenae</i>.

<i>not one phlyctaena</i> is originated
on patients scratching
themselves, but <i>many</i> minute
ones like millet seeds, closely
covering the affected part;
and when these have broken,
a kind of scabby sore is
produced. And in cases of
<i>anthrax</i> (malignant pustule),
which was at one time epidemic
in Asia, in some patients
even without there having been
previous <i>phlyctaenae</i>, the skin
was immediately destroyed).—Comp.

War, bk. II. ch. 49., Διεξῄει
γὰρ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος
ἄνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ
κεφαλῇ πρώτον ἱδρυθὲν
κακόν· καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν

γὰρ ἐς αἰδοῖα
καὶ ἐς ἄκρας χεῖρας καὶ
πόδας· καὶ πολλοὶ στερισκόμενοι
τούτων διέφευγον·
(for translation see text above).
In this passage it is usual to
read ἀντίληψις <em class="gesperrt">αὐτοῦ</em>
ἐπεσήμαινε, supplying κακοῦ
from the previous clause to
go with αὐτοῦ—(the seizure
of the disease itself on the
extremities manifested itself);
but even supposing the double
genitive with ἀντίληψις defensible,
the construction is still
very awkward, and is made
still more so by the fact that
in taking it this way we are
compelled to translate ἐπεσήμαινε
by “manifested itself”
(mali vis, apprehendens extremas
corporis partes se
prodebat, manifestam faciebat,—the
strength of the disease
declared itself, made itself
manifest, in seizing the extremities
of the body,—is
Wittenbach’s interpretation,
Select. Hist. p. 367.), without
by so doing obtaining any
clear meaning of the sentence.
On the other hand this is got
directly we read with <i>Reiske</i>
(Annotations p. 21. in his
“Thucydides Reden, übersetzt
von Reiske, nebst lateinischen
Anmerkungen über
dessen gesammtes Werk,”—Speeches
in Thucydides translated
into German by Reiske,
together with Latin Notes on
his “Histories” generally,
Leipzig 1761. 8vo.) ἀντίληψις
<em class="gesperrt">αὐτὸν</em> ἐπεσήμαινε,—a
seizure put its mark on him.
But whether αὐτοῦ is read
or αὐτὸν in any case it will
be impossible to take the
sentence as <i>Kraus</i>, p. 54., has
done, when he says: “The
pustulous suppurative eruption
begins with the head and
spreads little by little over
the entire body even to the
hands and feet. The fact that
Thucydides had the eruption
especially in his mind when
he speaks of the gradual spread
of the evil throughout the
whole body is shown by the
expressions chosen by him
“The disease goes through
the entire body and <i>marks</i>
(ἐπεσήμαινε) hands and feet.”
Now by what other of the
symptoms mentioned would
the affection of the hands and
feet have been likely to make
itself evident except by the
eruption?” There must surely
be few readers of Thucydides
capable of putting so radically
false an interpretation on the
Historian’s words.</p>

It may be mentioned by
way of supplement that Leprosy
among the Ancients was pretty
nearly universally regarded as
a punishment from the gods.
Even the Greeks held this
view, as comes out clearly
from <i>Aeschylus</i>, Choeph. II. 2.
This fact points to various
conclusions as to liability to
infection in Leprosy and the
obscurity in which the causes
of the disease are involved.</p></div>

In accordance with the
explanations given on a previous
page it might be thought
quite conceivable that so long
as the hymen was intact, a
part of the mucous discharge
of the vagina and of the
menstrual blood was retained,
and acquired a certain degree
of malignity. This acting on
points of the penis where the
surface had been accidentally
broken in the act of defloration,
or even on the mucous membrane
of the urethra, might
exert an injurious influence.</p></div>

(Now all the Barbarians that
dwell towards the West, use
pitch as a depilatory, and shave
their bodies. Indeed amongst
the Tyrrhenians establishments
are fitted up in numbers for
this purpose, and there are
artistes who practise this profession,
like barbers among
ourselves. And when men go
into their shops, they expose
themselves in every part, feeling
no shame of spectators
nor of passers-by. And this
custom is followed also by
many of the Greeks and of
the inhabitants of Italy, who
have learned it from Samnites
and Messapians). The depilation
of men and boys was
attended to by women (<i>Martial</i>,
XI. 79.) at the period
of the highest degree of dissoluteness;
in fact there was
a special guild of such women,
known as <i>ustriculae</i>. <i>Tertullian</i>,
De pallio ch. 4. In the
same way men performed this
service for women, as e.g.
<i>Domitian</i>, according to <i>Suetonius</i>,
ch. 22., Erat fama, quasi
concubinas ipse develleret
(Rumour went, to the effect
that the Emperor used to
“pluck” his mistresses with
his own hand,)—and <i>Heliogabalus</i>
according to <i>Lampridius</i>,
ch. 31., In balneis
semper cum mulieribus fuit,
ita ut eas ipse psilothro curaret,
ipse quoque barbam psilothro
accurans, quodque pudendum
dictu est, eodem quo mulieres
accurabantur, et eadem hora.
Rasit et virilia subactoribus
suis ad novaculam manu sua,
qua postea barbam fecit. (At
the baths he was always with
the women, going so far as
to apply the “psilothrum”
(a depilatory) in their treatment
himself, finishing off
his own beard also with
“psilothrum”, and using, disgusting
to relate, the same as
the women were being treated
with, and at one and the same
time. Moreover he shaved his
debauchees’(pathics) privates
to the navel with his own
hand, and then shaved his
own beard).</p></div>

Such <i>nice allurements</i> are for

a man’s member should be
fain to belong to it.) This
passage, together with those
quoted a little above from
Aristophanes and Theopompus,
will explain sufficiently what
<i>Horace</i> (Sat. I. 2. v. 36.) meant
by his “mirator <i>cunni</i> Cupiennius
<i>albi</i>,” (Cupiennius admirer
of a <i>white organ</i>), for the
<i>albus</i> (white) here evidently
stands for <i>rasus</i>, <i>depilatus</i>,
<i>nudus</i>, (shaven, freed from
hair, bare); as in <i>Juvenal</i>,
Sat. I. 111., Nuper in hanc
urbem <i>pedibus</i> qui venerat
<i>albis</i>, (Who but now had
arrived in this city with white,
i. e. bare, feet.) The commentators
have hitherto always
explained it by <i>matrona stola
alba</i>, seu <i>candida</i>, <i>vestita</i>, (a
matron clad in a white, or
glistening-white, robe), because,
as <i>Heindorf</i> puts it, no other
interpretation is to hand. But
really there are several possible
explanations on similar lines.
It might be for “<i>canus</i> cunnus”,
(hoary, aged; organ) (<i>Martial</i>,
bk. IX. 38., bk. II. 34.), though
again the meaning of <i>depilatus</i>
(free of hair), in another sense,
might equally well be at the
bottom of this, as is the case
with <i>cana labra</i> (hoary, white,
lips)—IX. 28. Or <i>albus</i> (white)
may be taken as synonymous
with <i>increta</i>, <i>cerussata</i> (whitened
with chalk, painted with
ceruse), to which <i>Martial</i>
supplies the explanation, when
he says (III. 42.),</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Lomento rugas uteri quod condere tentas,</div>
  <div class="verse">Polla, tibi ventrem, non mihi labra linis;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(When you endeavour to hide
the wrinkles on your stomach
with powder, ’tis your own
belly, Polla, not my lips, you
smear with the stuff),—as
also bk. IX. 3., Illa <i>siligineis</i>
pinguescit adultera <i>cunnis</i>, (It—i.
e. your penis—in adulterous
loves, grows fat on women’s
organs powdered with fine
wheaten flour); [but another
way of taking the line is:
She, i. e. your mistress,—adulterous
dame, grows fat on
wheaten cakes—cakes baked
in the shape of <i>cunni</i>.] The
<i>Lomentum</i>, which is not
derived from <i>lavimentum</i> or
<i>lavamentum</i> (something to
wash with), as Scheller, following
Voss, makes it to be, but
from the Greek λείωμα faba
communita (<i>ground</i> beans),
was bean-meal (<i>Vegetius</i>, De
re veterin. V. 62., says: in
subtilissimo lomento, hoc est
farina fabacea, (in the finest
<i>lomentum</i>, that is bean-flour.);
and at the present day the
Japanese, it seems, according
to <i>Thunberg</i>, use a kind of
bean-meal instead of soap.
Roman ladies were most careful
to maintain the <i>aequor
ventris</i> (smoothness of the
belly)—<i>Aulus Gellius</i>, Noctes
Att. I. 2.); whence <i>Martial</i>,
(III. 72.) says, addressing
Laufella, who refuses to bathe
with him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Aut tibi pannosae pendent a pectore mammae</div>
  <div class="verse">Aut <em class="gesperrt">sulcos uteri</em> prodere nuda times.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(Either your breasts hang
flabby from your bosom, or
you fear, if you strip, to
betray the furrows on your
belly.) To obviate wrinkles
on the face, they sprinkled
their faces with chalk; and
so <i>Petronius</i>, (Satyr. ch. 23.)
says: et inter rugas malarum
tantum erat cretae, ut putares
detectum parietem nimbo laborare,
(and amidst the wrinkles
of the cheeks was so much
chalk, that you would think
a partition-wall had been
stripped and was wrapped
in a cloud of dust); and we
read in <i>Lucian’s</i> poem (Greek
Anthology, Bk. II. tit. 9.)
μὴ τοίνυν τὸ πρόσωπον
ἅπαν ψιμύθῳ κατάπλαττε.
(Now don’t besmear all your
face with ceruse). However
if <i>cunnus must</i> be taken as
equivalent to <i>femina</i> (a woman),
it would be on all
fours with <i>albus amicus</i> (white,
white-faced, friend) in <i>Martial</i>
(bk. X. 12.), which <i>Farnabius</i>
explains by σκιατρόφος (reared
in the shade, delicate), answering
more or less to our “<i>Whey-face</i>”.
At any rate <i>any</i> of
these interpretations are for
certain nearer the truth than
the <i>stola alba</i> (clad in <i>a
white robe</i>) one.</p></div>

I Samuel, Ch. XVII. v. 14.
It is true we find even in Genesis
the covenant with Jehovah
celebrated by Abraham by
means of circumcision; but it
was in later times only in
each case that this custom
was referred back to him as
being racial father of the
Nation. For the same reason
in the case of Joshua the
matter is so represented as
if the Jews had been already
circumcised at their expulsion
from Egypt. If this had really
and truly been the case, it is
impossible to see why circumcision
was not carried out on
those born on the march to
Canaan. They were perfectly
able to keep other laws, and
they could have observed this
too, if it had been given them
at the time!</p></div>

(Lectures on certain Chronic

<em class="gesperrt">ut quasdam

antiquissima plane consuetudo,
idcirco fortassis instituta
fuerat, atque tanquam
ritus sacer, tanquam praeceptum
quoddam, de quo dispensari
nemo queat, introducebatur,
quod circumcisus videatur
difficilius morbum urethrae
contrahere, rariusque ablato
scilicet praeputio, intra quod
virus haeret, rodit, cancros
facit, quod et ipsum efficitur

morte expiatum <em class="gesperrt">videntur
docere, scivisse antiquitatem
remotissimam,
morbum quendam gravem,

I pronounce it—Venereal
disease—to be of most ancient
origin, and to have been of
such frequency among the
Egyptians, Jews, as well as
the Greeks and Romans, that
it may well <i>be possible to
discover in it the cause of
sundry habits, customs, laws
and enactments of these
Peoples</i>.... For instance the
precept of circumcision, evidently
an extremely ancient
custom, was very possibly first
instituted for this reason, and
was introduced in the guise
of a sacred rite, a ceremonial
precept from which there can
be no dispensation, because
the circumcised man would
seem less readily to contract
disease of the urethra, and in
cases where the prepuce has
been removed, inside which
the poison remains adherent
and corrodes, less frequently
suffers from chancres, an effect
that follows in its worst form
in phymosis and paraphymosis.
The <i>glans penis</i> itself in a
man thus treated seems to
absorb the poison less easily,
being in fact grown partially
callous.... The fact that the
sign of virginity was scrupulously
examined in newly
married virgins, the careful
guard kept over women
throughout the East, the
penalty of death attached to
the crime of adultery, especially
in women, <i>all seem to
show that the remotest Antiquity
was aware of some
serious, foul disease being
given and communicated by
indiscriminate Love</i>.</p></div>

<i>Plutarch</i>, On Isis and
Osiris ch. 94. Hence we commonly
find among the Ancients
the custom, merely after the
evacuation of urine and fæces,
of cleansing the parts concerned.
Accordingly <i>Josephus</i>,
De Bello Judaic. Bk. II. ch.
8., says: καίπερ δὲ φυσικῆς
οὔσης τῆς τῶν σωματικῶν λυμάτων
ἐκκρίσεως ἀπολούεσθαι
μετ’αὐτὴν, καθάπερ
μεμιασμένοις, ἔθιζον. (And
even though the evacuation
of the bodily defilements was
in the course of nature, they
were accustomed to wash themselves
after it, as in the case
of men polluted). The Romans
used for the purpose a sponge
fastened to the end of a stick,
as we see from <i>Seneca</i>, Letter
70, where he says: Lignum,
quod ad emendanda obscoena
adhaerente spongia positum
est, totum in gulam sparsit,
(The stick that is placed with
a sponge fixed to it for
cleansing filth, this he shook
right in his mouth). Slaves
took stones, bulbs, etc. for
the purpose. <i>Aristophanes</i>,
Plut. IV. 1. After making
water it was usual to wash the
hands. <i>Petronius</i>, Satyr. 27.
Exonerata ille vesica, aquam
poposcit ad manus. (After
relieving his bladder, he asked
for water for his hands). This
care for cleanliness roused,
as mentioned before, the
utmost anger on the part
of Saint Athanasius; but
it is to this day the custom
among the Turks, for it is
enjoined by the Koran (Sure
IV. 42.), even adding that
only one hand ought to be
used (<i>Niebuhr</i>, Description of
Arabia, p. 78.), namely the
<i>left</i>. The same hand was
used also by the Romans,
as well as perhaps by all
ancient Peoples. Hence <i>Martial</i>
says, bk. XI. 59., sed lota
mentula laeva.... (but my
member, when my left hand
has been washed....). With
the left hand, amica manus (the
<i>mistress</i> hand), masturbation
was performed, <i>Martial</i>, IX.
42. XI. 74.; it served to
cover the genitals, <i>Lucian</i>,
Amor. 13., hence according
to <i>Ovid</i>, Ars amandi, Bk.
II. 613.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ipsa Venus pubem quoties velamina ponit,</div>
  <div class="verse">Protegitur laeva semireducta manu</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
(Venus herself, as oft as she
lays aside her garments, half
withdrawn covers herself with
her left hand), and Priapus
is represented in Art holding
the penis with the left hand,
Priapeia 24. 34. If we are
not mistaken, this was also
the case with Horus among
the Egyptians. What has just
been said explains at the same
time the reason why the left
hand has from of old been
held in disrepute, an idea
still preserved in the expression,
to marry, to be married,
<i>with the left hand</i>.</p></div>

as well, the disease (Venereal)
would undoubtedly be still
more widely spread.”</p></div>

(What! do you a matron
penetrate into women’s secret
haunts? and by stealth are
you washed, O female organ,
in the water that appertains
to you?) <i>Petronius</i>, Sat. 94.,
Itaque extra cellam processit,
tanquam <i>aquam peteret</i>. (And
so she came forward outside
her chamber, and if she <i>were
going for water</i>).—<i>Cicero</i>,
Orat. pro Caelio, ch. 14.
represents his grandfather
Appius Claudius Caecus, who
(442 A.U.C.) had constructed
the Appian Way, say to his
depraved granddaughter: Ideo
aquam adduxi ut ea tu inceste
uterere? (Was it for this I
brought the water to Rome,
that you might use it for
abominable purposes?) Comp.
Casaubon on Cicero, Letters
to Atticus, bk. I. Letter 16.
For the same reason women
and girls who only rarely
participated in sexual intercourse
were called <i>siccae</i> (dry)
(<i>Plautus</i>, Miles Glor. III. 1.
192. <i>Martial</i>, XI. Epigr. 82.
<i>Petronius</i>, Sat. 37.), in contrast
to the <i>uda puella</i> (wet girl)
<i>Juvenal</i>, Sat. X. 321. <i>Martial</i>,
XI. 17., who was obliged
to wash herself frequently.
So too <i>illota</i> or <i>illauta</i> virgo
(unwashed maid) stands for
<i>intacta</i> virgo (untouched maid),
as in <i>Plautus</i>, Poenul. I. sc.
2. 22. Nam quae lavata est,
nisi perculta est, meo quidem
animo, quasi <i>illauta</i> est. (For
she who is washed, unless
she is bedecked as well, in
my opinion, is as good as
<i>unwashed</i>). In fact the whole
of this scene is important for
our subject.</p></div>

<i>Aquarioli</i>: Aquarioli dicebantur
mulierum impudicarum
sordidi asseclae. (Aquarioli, or
water-boys, a name given to
the shameless attendants of
immodest women).—<i>Tertullian</i>,
Apologet. ch. 43. They
were also known as <i>baccariones</i>
from baccarium, a word which
<i>Isidor</i> explains by aquarium
(a water vessel). An old
Gloss says: baccario πορνοδιάκονος,
meritricibus aquam
infundens (baccario, a prostitutes’
attendant, one who pours
water for whores); another:
aquarioli, βαλλάδες, βαλλὰς,
from βάλλων ὕδωρ, ab aqua
jaciunda (water-boys, or throwers,
from throwing water).
These aquarioli at the same
time carried on the business
of procurers; so <i>Juvenal</i>
says, Sat. VI. 331., veniet
conductus aquarius. (Some
water-carrier will come, hired
for the purpose). Comp. <i>Lipsius</i>,
Antiq. lect. I. 12. Hence
also the word <i>aquaculare</i> was
used meaning lenocinari (to
be a pandar); see <i>Turnebus</i>,
Adversar. XIV. 12. XXVIII.
5. Besides this they held
themselves, especially in the
public baths, at the disposal
of lustful women, very often
earning in this way the Bath
farthing they had to pay.
Probably Dasius in <i>Martial</i>,
bk. II. Epigr. 52., was such
an Aquariolus.</p>

(The artful masseur too pressed
his fingers on the clytoris,

his mistress’thigh resound
under his hands). From the
passage of <i>Martial</i> it follows
that <i>Busch</i>, “Handbuch der
Erfindungen,” (Manual of
Inventions), vol. II. p. 8., is
mistaken in saying: <i>Women</i>
and persons not yet adult
had the bath <i>gratis</i>; in fact
in the passage from Juvenal,
Sat. II. 152., quoted by him,
it is a question of boys only.
For the rest, the Aquarioli
recall the λουτροφόροι (water-bearers)
of the Greeks; these
were boys, whose duty it
was to fetch the water for
the Bride’s bath before marriage.

(And of a truth they would
not strip before their own
husbands, feigning a pretended
plausibility of mock-modesty;
but for other men, whosoever
will, may readily see the women
that are so close shut up at
home, naked at the Baths.
For there they are nowise
ashamed to strip before the
spectators, looking on like
dealers in human flesh; whereas
Hesiod (Works and Days, bk.
II. 371.) advises “But do not,
for the earning of a woman’s
price, let her wash her skin
bright and clean.” Now the
Baths are open for men and
women alike. And hence their
stripping leads to incontinence;
for from seeing, men come to
desire, as though their modesty
were washed away in the
Baths. Other women that have
not attained such effrontery,
shut out strangers indeed, but
wash along with their own
house-slaves, and are stripped
naked before their servants
and are rubbed by them, giving
opportunity to the man a-tremble
with longing, the free
right to handle without fear;
for the men that are admitted
into the Baths with their naked
mistresses take care to strip in
such a way as to correspond
to the daring audacity of their
longing, putting down fear to
the count of evil habit).—<i>Cyprian</i>,

Quid vero, quae promiscuas
balneas adeunt, quae oculis

in truth, those women that
frequent indiscrimate Baths,
that expose to prying and
lustful eyes their bodies that
should be dedicate to modest
shamefacedness, that along

to see and in nakedness
are seen by men, do not
such women offer an enticement

<i>Seneca</i>, Epist. 86. says,
speaking of the bath of Scipio:
Balneolum angustum, tenebricosum
ex consuetudine antiqua;
non videbatur maioribus nostris
caldum nisi obscurum. (A little
narrow bath-chamber, dim
and gloomy after the antique
fashion; our fathers could not
believe a bath warm unless
it was dark too).—Next he
describes explicitly the luxury
of the Roman Baths, and then
goes on,—In hoc balneo Scipionis
minimae sunt rimae
magis quam fenestrae, muro
lapideo exsectae, ut sine iniuria
munimenti lumen admitterent.
At nunc <em class="gesperrt">blattaria</em> vocant
<em class="gesperrt">balnea</em>, si qua non ita
aptata sunt, ut totius diei
solem fenestris amplissimis
recipiant; nisi et lavantur et
colorantur; nisi ex solio agros
et maria prospiciant.... Imo
si scias, non quotidie lavabatur.
Nam ut aiunt, qui priscos mores
urbis tradiderunt, brachia et
crura quotidie abluebant, quae
scilicit sordes opere collegerant:
ceterum toti nundinis lavabantur.
Hoc loco dicet aliquis,
liquet mihi immundissimos
fuisse. Quid putas illos oluisse?
militiam, laborem, virum. Postquam
munda balnea inventa
sunt, spurciores sunt. (In this
bath of Scipio there are tiny
chinks rather than windows,
cut through the stone wall,
so as to admit light without
detriment to the shelter afforded.
But nowadays men
call them <i>Baths for night-moths</i>,
any that are not disposed
in such a way as to let the
sunlight enter all day long
by immense windows; if they
are not washed and sun-burned
at once; if they cannot look
out on fields and sea from
the pavement.... If you must
know the truth, he did not
bathe every day. For we are
told by those who have handed
down accounts of the primitive
manners of the City, our
ancestors would wash daily
arms and legs, for these had
grown soiled with the dust
of toil: but they washed all
over only on market-days.
Hearing this, it will be said,
“It appears to me they must
have very filthy people.”
Well! what think you it was
they smelt of? Of fighting,
and honest work, and manly
vigour. Sweet, clean Baths
have been introduced; but the
population is only more foul).

It must be left to future

the great number of <i>phalli</i>

the very great cleanliness of
the Turks, who after every
occasion of sexual intercourse
not only wash carefully, but
also wherever it is possible
go to the bath likewise, the
disease would undoubtedly
be yet more widely spread
than it is.... Yet the Turk
will never admit, or rather
he simply cannot bring himself
to conceive, that he has contracted
an infection through
unclean cohabitation, but will
be found always to give some
other cause as occasioning his
sickness. In fact the language
itself shows this; the Turkish
expression for gonorrhœa is
“<i>Belzouk</i>”, literally: chill of
the back (from <i>bel</i>, back and
<i>zouk</i>, cold), and chill or overheating
will always be represented

this delayed appearance of

We see this in the clearest
possible way from the passage
of <i>Herodotus</i>, bk. I. ch. 9,
10., where Candaules wishes
to induce Gyges to see his
wife naked, in order to convince
him of her beauty, but
the latter objects: ἅμα δὲ
κιθῶνι ἐκδυομένῳ συνεκδύεται
καὶ τὴν αἰδῶ γυνή·
πάλαι δὲ τὰ καλὰ ἀνθρώποισι
ἐξεύρηται, ἐκ τῶν
μανθάνειν δεῖ· (but when
she strips off her tunic, a
woman strips off therewith
her modesty likewise; now
mankind have long ago ascertained
what is honourable,
and from this we must learn
how to act). Then Herodotus
adds to this further (ch. 10.),
παρὰ γὰρ τοῖσι Λυδοῖσι,
σχεδὸν δὲ παρὰ τοῖσι ἄλλοισι
βαρβάροισι, καὶ ἄνδρα ὀφθῆναι
γυμνὸν, ἐς αἰσχύνην

In any case it is an error to
suppose that by this it is implied
that the maidens and young
men were absolutely naked.
They were merely μονόπεπλοι
(single-frocked), clothed in a
single short frock, slit up at
the hips, for which reason
they were also known by the
name φαινομηρίδες (showing
the thighs) (<i>Pollux</i>, Onomastic.
VII. 55.), a costume which
was pretty much the general
Doric one; thus <i>Moeris</i> says
δωριάζειν τὸ παραγυμνοῦσθαί
τινα μέρη, (to follow
Dorian fashions, to expose
certain parts). Comp. <i>Meursius</i>,

II. p. 328. The meaning of
γυμνὸς is nothing more than
“lightly clad”, in mere underclothing,
without outer cloak.
So <i>Eubulus</i>, (Athenaeus bk.
XIII. p. 568.) says, speaking
of the brothel-girls, γυμνάς—ἐν
λεπτονήτοις ὑμέσιν ἑστωτας
(standing “naked”—in
light-spun garments). <i>Aelian</i>,
Var. hist. XIII. 37., ἐν
χιτωνίσκῳ γυμνὸς, (“naked”
in a tunic). Similarly <i>nudus</i>
(naked) in Latin, as <i>Cuper</i>
(Observat. bk. I. ch. 7.) long
ago pointed out, often has no
other meaning, but merely
stands for <i>tunicatus</i> (clad in
the tunic), in tunic only,
without cloak or toga. We see
this very clearly in <i>Petronius</i>,
Satir. 55., Aequum est induere
nuptam ventum textilem,—Palam
prostare nudam in
nebula linea. (’Tis right a
bride should put on woven
wind,—that she should stand
openly for sale, “naked” in
a linen cloud!) In precisely

in which these principles are
expressed in Court, to induce
the Judges to condemn the
dissolute Cinesias: τοῦτον δὲ

τελευτῆσαι τὸν βίον, τούτοις
μόνοις, προσήκει τοῖς τὰ

(But this man,
who is known to most of you,
the gods have brought to such
a pass that his enemies may
well wish him to live rather
than die, to be an example to
other men, showing them that
where men’s conduct is too
violently overbearing towards
the gods, these do not inflict
punishments on their children,
but pay them out in person
with misfortunes, bringing
down on them calamities and
diseases greater and more
severe than fall to the lot of
others. For death and sickness
are admittedly common to all
of you; but to continue so
long in such a condition, and
dying every day, yet not be
able to have done with his
life, this is the fate only of
men who have committed such
evil deeds as he has). Again,
the Taxili, an Indian people,
regarded any bodily sickness
as disgraceful, and on its appearance
gave themselves to
the fire; αἴσχιστον δ’αὐτοῖς
νομίζεσθαι νόσον σωματικήν·
τὸν δ’ὑπονοήσαντα καθ’
αὑτοῦ τοῦτο ἐξάγειν ἑαυτὸν

(But they hold a bodily disease
to be most disgraceful;
and the man who has formed
a suspicion of the existence
of such in himself, goes through
the fire, after making a funeral
pyre) says <i>Strabo</i>, Geograph.

At the same time we learn
from this document, that even
then paederastia was wide-spread
enough already, and
that physicians were actually
not ashamed to abuse their
patients in this, as in other
vicious ways! Undoubtedly it

As a rule they ascribed
the origin of the contagion
to σῆψις (putrefaction), and
from their point of view
septic, or putrefactive, diseases
were pretty much the same
as infectious (<i>Galen</i>, De febr.
diff. I. 4.). Hence it would
seem probable the ἕλκεα
σηπεδόνα (putrefying ulcers)
were at any rate partly looked
at in the same light,—a
circumstance of the highest importance
as bearing on ulcers
of the genitals, as in that
case these latter are manifestly
represented as being infectious.
It is to be hoped that experts
will give their decision as to
this. At any rate as early
as <i>Galen’s</i> time (De locis
effect. bk. VI. ch. 5., edit.
Kühn Vol. VIII. p. 422.)
the action of contagion was
regarded as analogous to that
of the electric ray-fish (νάρκη
θαλάττιος) and the magnet,
and the conclusion was drawn:
ταῦτά τε οὖν ἱκανὰ τεκμήρια
τοῦ σμικρὰν οὐσίαν ἀλλοιώσεις
μεγίστας ἐργάζεσθαι
μόνῳ τῷ ψαῦσαι. (these then
are sufficient evidences of the
fact that a small creature may
produce very great variations
by contact alone).</p></div>

you may learn from the

forms of epilepsy, as also from
the affection which is known
as gonorrhœa. For in violent
epileptic seizures, because the
whole body is strongly convulsed,
and with it the procreative
parts, for this reason
the semen is secreted; whereas
in gonorrhœas the affection
is one solely of the actual

(However the most troublesome
condition of body is the

copious and hot semen,
and this provokes them to
ejaculation, then after its
ejaculation, they grow relaxed
at the neck of the belly, ...
and become weak, and dried
up, and thin, and pale, and
hollow-eyed,—the patients
that find themselves so affected.
And if after suffering
in these ways, they then
indulge in the intercourse of
sexual love, they are afflicted
in head and in stomach, and
with nausea. Nor on the other
hand do they get any great
benefit from continence; for
they come, by having pollutions
in dreams, to undergo
similar inconveniences to those
they incurred in sexual intercourse.
And as one of them
said to me, <i>he experienced a
biting and exceedingly hot
sensation from the semen in
its ejaculation,—and not
himself only, but also such

(Gonorrhœa is not
indeed a dangerous thing, but
it <i>is</i> a disagreeable one, and
one that is <i>in the highest
degree unseemly in repute</i>.
For if incontinence and <i>paresis</i>
attack the soft procreative
parts, the semen flows all the
same even though the organs
are cold, nor is it possible to
stop it even in sleep; for
whether a man sleep, or wake,
the running is continual, and
the flow of the seed goes on
unconsciously. <i>And women
also are subject to this complaint</i>;
but in their case the
discharge of the semen is accompanied
with itchings and
with pleasurable feeling, as
well as with shameless intercourse
with men, whereas men
are not in any way excited.
And the moisture that is
discharged is thin, cold, colourless,
unfruitful; for how should
its nature, that is cold, send
forth fertile semen? And if
young men suffer from it,
they are bound to grow old
in constitution and condition,
sluggish, relaxed, lifeless, hesitating,
dull of hearing, weak,
shrunken, ineffectual, pallid,
white, womanish, without appetite,
chilly, heavy of limb,
and stiff of leg and palsied in
every part. This complaint is
the avenue to paralysis for
many; for how should this
power of the nerves not suffer
when the natural parts pertaining
to the generation of
life are chilled).</p></div>

(Such is proved to have been
another antecedent cause of
the above named malady,
which we call <i>discharge of
semen</i>; but a distinct cause
has to be assigned, if it so
be that the malady in question
makes the semen flow even
by day and when the patients
are awake, and though no
dream provokes to the exercise
of love). <i>Philagrius</i> appears
to have made this distinction
quite correctly, when as quoted
by <i>Aëtius</i> (Tetrab. III. serm.
3. ch. 34.), De seminis in
somno profluvio, Philagrii (On
the discharge of semen in
sleep, according to Philagrius),
he says: Semen in somnis
profundere dicuntur quicumque
dum dormiunt, <em class="gesperrt">naturae
genitale semen</em> emittunt,
quod ipsum eis ut
plurimum ob vitiati humoris
materiam, aut materiae multitudinem
aut ob partium seminalium
robur contingit. Iam
vero quidam et ob animi
moestitiam aut inediam, per
somnos praeter consuetudinem
semen excreverunt, atque id
materiae acrimonia irritati, non
ob partium seminalium robur,
pertulerunt etc. (They are said
to discharge semen in sleep,
whoever during slumber, ejaculate
<i>the genital seed of nature</i>,
because they possess it in the
greatest degree of abundance
either on account of the constituting
material of the semen
being vitiated or on account
of the copiousness of this
material, or else on account
of the vigour of the seminal
organs. But there are also
many cases where men have
emitted semen in sleep contrary
to their wont in consequence
of sadness of spirits or fasting,
having done so because irritated
by the acridness of the
material, and not through any
vigour of the seminal organs,
etc.). The only pity is that
Aëtius has not preserved for
us his (Philagrius’) opinion as
to gonorrhœa, and has not
shown clearly exactly what
belongs to Philagrius in the
Chapter; for a great deal, as
indeed is stated, is from Galen
and referred by the compiler
to gonorrhœa. Philagrius in
fact only lived in the latter
half of the Fourth Century,—A.D.
364 according to Sprengel,
300 according to Lessing.</p></div>

an effection of the seminal

<i>This complaint does not indeed
as a rule cause any very

in consequence of the constant
involuntary discharge of semen.
However sometimes it may
arise from a flux in the seminal
vessels, and <i>occasionally on

profuse discharge of
semen supervenes</i>. The malady
particularly attacks those who
have passed the period of puberty but are under fourteen,
but other ages are also liable.
And the semen that is discharged
is watery, thin, the
discharge being unaccompanied
with any desire for coition,
and indeed as a rule without
any feeling whatever, though
at times taking place with a
certain voluptuous sensation.
The whole body of those
attacked suffers and becomes
wasted, especially in the lumbar
region. There follows
great weakness, not so much
owing to the amount of the
semen discharged as to the
nature of the parts affected.
<i>Again, this disease is not
peculiar to men, but assails
young women as well, and
in the case of females is
eliminated with very great
difficulty.</i> However the treatment
is the same as that applied
in all fluxes. First of all
therefore patients must observe
rest and a scanty diet both
in food and drinking water;
then the loins and pubis should
be covered with cloths moistened
with wine, and <i>rosaceum</i>
and oenanthinum and
melinum (oil of roses, of
young vine buds, of melilot).
Sponges soaked in posca (acid
drink of vinegar and water)
are also appropriate. Then on
the succeeding days cataplasms
of palms, apples, acacia, hypocisthis
(parasitic plant growing
on the cisthus), wild vine, red
wild-poppy, and the like.
Embrocations moreover should
be employed of an astringent
character, consisting of a
decoction of the mastic,
bramble, myrtle and the like,
in hard wine, whether unmixed
or diluted. Diet should embrace
such foods as resist
corruption and deterioration,
and possess a desiccative
quality. Along with the food
and drink should be administered
the juice of the agnus
castus and of <i>hemp</i>, especially
after boiling. Also the juice
and leaves of rue, the juice
of lettuce and colewort and
the root of nymphaea (water-lily).
As to drink for daily
use, instead of ordinary water,
water should be given in which
<i>iron has been repeatedly
tempered</i>. Some practitioners
indeed have administered the
bark of the root of the bladder-wort
in water as a beverage
for such patients, and it will
not be inappropriate to make
trial of this on occasion. Another
<i>antidote of great renown</i>
is exhibited with advantage
both for sufferers from this
discharge of semen, as well
as for constant fluxes of all
kinds. Take of juice of the
sallow Ʒvjj, of calamint Ʒvj,
of juice of the white agnus
castus Ʒv, of rue Ʒjv, of juice
of hemlock Ʒjj; compound
with water into small cakes
or lozenges, and administer
one of these of the size of a
hazel-nut along with three
cups of posca (vinegar and
water). <i>But the patient must
avoid all eating of acrid things and the drinking of
much wine</i> and the use of
vegetables; the diet must be
generally of a desiccative and
astringent type. Moreover
presently after the earlier
stages embrocations and an
active mode of life should be
adopted, whereby the whole
body and particularly the parts
affected are brought into a
healthy state; the embrocations
should be persevered in for long
periods of time, but washing
on the other hand sparingly
employed, if we wish to remedy
the lassitude and acrid habit
of body. It will be of advantage
moreover, <i>if there is
nothing to prevent, to have
recourse to cold bathing</i>,
which has the property of
expelling all diseases arising
from flux, more especially if
the water is endowed with a
healing quality, such as the
waters of Albulae, which also
are of the greatest use in these
cases when taken as a drink.
They are of a slightly salt
taste, and of a milky warmth
to the touch. Further, it is
suitable to employ at intervals
lotions and poultices and plasters,
such as will redden and
soften the skin, and bring to
the surface those matters that
lie latent underneath. Again,
<i>rest should frequently be
taken lying on the side</i>, the
leaves of calamint and rue and
agnus castus being spread as
a couch. A poultice employed
in these cases is as follows.
Pound a quantity of Venus-hair
and rub it up with vinegar
or parsley juice or that of
endive or fleabane, add to it
the cooked meat of snails,
pack all together in a linen
cloth and lay upon the hips.
Also the wax plaster prescribed
for priapism should be employed,
and the remedies to
be mentioned presently for
discharges of semen during
sleep. Lastly <i>all thinking
about love ought to be
avoided</i>.)</p></div>

Similarly <i>Aretaeus</i>, Morb.
chron. therap. bk. II. ch. 5.,
says: εἰ δὲ καὶ σώφρων ἔοι
ἐπὶ τοῖσι ἀφροδισίοισι καὶ
λούοιτο ψυχρῷ, ἐλπὶς ὡς
ὤκιστα ἀνδρωθῆναι τὸν
ἄνθρωπον, (And if he indulge
with moderation in love and
bathe in cold water, there is
good hope that the man will
rapidly recover manly vigour).
This need surprise us the less,
if we remember that the notion
of a superfluitas seminis (superfluity
of seed),—this was why
Diogenes practised onanism,
<i>Galen</i>, Vol. VIII. p. 419.,—was
all the time in the background,
and gonorrhœa according
to Caelius Aurelianus
and other authorities actually
arose from too great self-continence.
Si igitur Venerem exercere
consueverit et crebriore
uti concubitu, nunc autem continentius
et purius innocentiusque
degat, sine dubio a copia
id sustinet cum partes illam
ferre nequeunt. (If therefore
a man is in the habit of
practising love and indulging
in fairly frequent cohabitation,
well and good; but if on the
contrary he live a too continent, pure and innocent life,
without a doubt he endures
this evil from the over-copiousness
(of semen), as the parts
cannot tolerate it.) This idea
owed its origin partly to the
confusion of gonorrhoea with
nocturnal pollutions,—a confusion
found even in the passage
from Galen quoted a little
above, and in especial was
revived in the XVth. and
XVIth. Centuries under the
auspices of the monks and
nuns. It at the same time gave
occasion to the practice of
resorting to copulation with a
maiden as a cure for gonorrhœa.
At any rate it was an
opinion already found in
Hippocrates, that copulation
was a desiccative measure
which in diseases arising from
the phlegmatic humour (<i>Hippocrates</i>,
Epidem. bk. VI.
Vol. III. p. 609., <i>Galen</i>,
XVII. A. p. 284.) is of
advantage to hot and moist
constitutions (<i>Galen</i>, Vol. VI.

have named “<i>female gonorrhœa</i>”;
and it is an escape
from the womb, because this
cannot retain the moist humours.
Further, it actually
changes the blood to a white
colour.) Perhaps too what
<i>Galen</i>, De semine bk. II. ch.
1. (IV. p. 599.), says is
pertinent in this connection:

appears to be a smaller and
moist discharge very often,
inside, coming from the womb
itself, in micturition). Again

spermatis spontanei et importuni

<i>Celsus</i>, De re medica
bk. VI. ch. 18., Solet

ulcus descendere; profluitque
pituita multa sanies tenuis
malique odoris, non coacta at

quamvis inter purulenta est,

curandum est.... Praecipueque
id ulcus multa calida aqua
fovendum est, velandumque
neque frigori committendum.
(Moreover the ulcer is wont
sometimes to descend to the
<i>cords</i>; and then there is discharged
a quantity of phlegm,
a thin <i>sanies</i> of an ill odour,
not congealed but like water
in which a piece of fresh meat
has been washed; and the
place experiences pain and a
pricking sensation. This sort,
though it comes under the
head of purulent complaints,
should nevertheless be treated
with mild drugs.... And
above all this form of ulcer
should be fomented with
copious warm water, and
should be covered and not
exposed to cold). From the
last sentence it may be concluded
that it is not the acute
form of blennorrhœa of the
urethra that is in question
here (bk. IV), but the chronic.
The words <i>ad nervos</i> (to the
cords) have given occasion to
some very extraordinary explanations.
<i>Simon</i>, Krit.
Gesch. Vol. I p. 23., considers
it would be most natural to
refer this to the inside of the
member, to the urethra in
fact, though as a matter of
fact gonorrhœa of the glans
penis might just as likely be
intended in the passage. But
in the latter case the interpretation
is absolutely impossible,
as the glans penis is
never called <i>nervus</i>. The
corpora cavernosa it is true
are described in several places
by <i>Galen</i>, e.g. De loc. aff.
bk. VI. ch. 6., as “a pipe-like
cord, for the body is cord-like
in form, the whole being
hollow like a pipe”, but he
adds χωρὶς τῆς καλουμένης
βαλάνου (always excepting
the glans penis, as it is called),
and indeed that <i>nervus</i> generally
signifies the penis is evident
at once from Horace,
Epod. XII. 19.; even the
plural <i>nervos</i> is found in
<i>Petronius</i>, Sat. 129., 134.,—so
the Greeks similarly use
νεῦρον (nerve, cord) for the
penis, sometimes with the
addition σπερματικὸν (spermatic,
seminal), as Eustathius
points out,—Comm. on the
Iliad, X. 1390. However
Celsus had no idea of this in
his mind; everything shows
that with him the <i>ad nervos</i>
points to nothing but the
<i>vasa deferentia</i> or spermatic
cords, as he distinctly declares
himself in bk. VII. ch. 18:
Dependent vero (testiculi) ab
inguinibus per <i>singulos nervos</i>,
quos κρεμαστῆρας Graeci
nominant. (But the testicles
hang from the groin by separate
cords, which the Greeks
call κρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders).
Similarly <i>Columella</i>, De re
rustic. bk. VI. ch. 26., Testium
nervos, quos Graeci κρεμαστῆρας
ab eo appellant, quod ex
illis genitales partes dependent.
(The cords of the testicles,
which the Greeks name κρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders,
because
the genital parts hang by
them); again <i>Pollux</i>, Onomast.
bk. II. Ch. 4., κρεμαστῆρας
δὲ λέγονται τὰ νεῦρα, τοῦς
διδύμους ἀνέχει. (κρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders,
is the name
of the cords; and they support
the testicles). The possibility
of the suppuration
extending to the seed reservoir
and the spermatic cords is
proved by the case lately
observed and made known
by <i>Ricord</i>.</p></div>

suspect some accretion of
tissue, the result of ulceration,
to be blocking the neck of
the bladder, our diagnosis will
depend both on the foregoing
signs of the existence of an
ulcer and also on the fact of
the urine being voided on the
introduction of a <i>catheter</i>.
Sometimes moreover I have
noted the following case to
occur; on turning the catheter
about pain was experienced
at the part of the canal where
we had previously conjectured
the ulceration to be situated,
and the tissue being broken
down by the catheter, there
followed after the evacuation
of the urine some blood and
particles of tissue.... Whether
in this case we ought to describe
the mischief as something
affecting the urethral
canal, or say that the cause
is something lying in the same
canal, is scientifically unimportant).
For the catheter
must always have the shape
of the passage leading to the
bladder (Method. med. bk.
IV. ch. 7. X. p. 301.); accordingly
it must be bent into
the shape of the letter “S”
(Introduct. ch. 19. Vol. XIV.
p. 788). The inventor of it
was Erasistratus (ibid. p. 751.).
The employment of the catheter
is well described by <i>Paulus
Aegineta</i> bk. VI. ch. 59., who
adds that different catheters
must be used according to
age and sex.</p></div>

<i>Aretaeus</i>, De sign. chronic.
bk. II. ch. 8., θώυμα δὲ
τουτέων μέζων, εἰς ὄρχιας
καὶ κρεμαστῆρας ἀδόκητον
ἄλγος ἐπιφοιτῇ· πολλοὺς τῶν
ἰητρῶν ἥδε ἡ ξυμπαθείη
λήθει· καὶ γὰρ καὶ ἐξέταμόν
κοτε τοὺς κρεμαστῆρας, ὡς
ἰδίην ἔχοντας αἰτίην· (And
there is another thing more
surprising than this, when the
pain suddenly shifts to the
testicles and spermatic cords.
Now this sympathy between
the different organs escapes
many physicians; and sometimes
they actually cut out
the spermatic cords as if these
contained the special cause of
the suffering). In the edition
due to Kühn’s industry the
word κρεμαστῆρες is translated
by <i>musculos cremasteres dictos</i>
(the muscles called cremasteres).
The expression is also
found in the “De sign. acut.”
II. 6., and <i>Petit</i> in his Commentary
on the first named
passage declares in all seriousness
that the sympathy was
sufficiently well known to anatomists,
arising from the connection
of the cremasteres
muscles with the peritonaeum
and its processes, which statement
appears to rest on the
datum of <i>Galen</i>, De usu
partium bk. XIV. ch. 11.
(IV. p. 193.) and De semine
bk. II. ch. 5. (IV. p. 635.),
where the cremasteres certainly
are called μυώδη σώματα
(muscular bodies) and compared
with the round ligaments
of the womb. Still <i>Galen</i> says
distinctly in the latter passage
that they contained arteries,
veins and the spermatic ducts,
in the Isagoge ch. 11. (XIV.
p. 719.) ὃς (γόνος) φέρεται
ἐπ’αὐτοὺς διὰ τῶν κρεμαστήρων
(it,—the seed,—is
conveyed to them through the
cremasteres). On the other
hand in the “De musc. sect.”
Vol. XVIII. B. p. 997., the
musculi cremasteres properly
so called are clearly described,
and the statement added: Τὸ
δὲ ἔργον αὐτῶν ἀνατείνειν
τὸν ὄρχιν· ὅθεν ἔνιοι κρεμαστῆρας
αὐτοὺς ὀνομάζουσι
(but their duty is to hold up
the testicles, for which reason
some name them the cremasteres,—suspenders).
Neither
Blancard-Kühn nor yet Kraus’s
Lexicon give under the word
“Cremaster” any meaning but
that of the muscles; the same
is true of Schneider. Comp.
<i>Paulus Aegineta</i> bk. VI. ch.
61., where the spermatic cords
are also called παραστάται
(supporters), as also by Galen,
Defin. med. XIX. p. 362.
and De semine bk. I. Vol.
IV. p. 565., where they are
spoken of as κιρσοειδῆς
παραστάται (varicose parastatae).
A denomination Herophilus
first made use of (Galen
IV. p. 582.) and which according
to <i>Athenaeus</i> Deipnos.
bk. IX. p. 396. was likewise
given to the testicles.</p>

with regard to the privates
and fundament we constantly
come back to the same conditions
of causation, viz. that
these parts are readily affected
by putrefaction, as well owing
to their natural moistness as
because they are channels for
excretions). Commentar. in
Hippocrat. De humor. (XVI.
p. 414.), ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡ φύσις
τῶν τόπων οὐ μικρὸν πρὸς
τὸ δέχεσθαι σηπεδόνας ποιεῖ·
καὶ γὰρ τὸ στόμα καὶ τὰ
αἰδοῖα πολλὴν ὑγρότητα τῇ
φύσει κέκτηται· καὶ προσέτι
τοὺς ἀδένας ἔχουσιν ἐγγὺς,
ἄπερ πάντα τὰ περιττὰ εἰσδέχεσθαι
πεφύκασιν. (Moreover
the nature of the localities
has no small influence on their
liability to putrefactive changes.
For the mouth and the private
parts possess much moisture
of their very nature; and
besides this they have the
glands close by, all which
circumstances tend naturally
to make them the receptacles
of excessive moisture). De usu
partium bk. XI. ch. 14. (III.
p. 910.), ἤδε δὲ καὶ περὶ τὴν
τῶν αἰδοίων φύσιν αἱ τρίχες
ἅμα μὲν ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἐγένοντο,
θερμὰ γὰρ καὶ ὑγρὰ τὰ
χωρία. (Now this quality and
the fact of the privates being
naturally surrounded with hair
would seem to be necessary
consequences, because the
localities are hot and damp).—<i>Cassius</i>,
Problem. 2., Cur
supremae corporis sedes ad
nomas sunt opportunae, similiter
et concavae? An quia
noma putrefactio est quaedam
et sensus interitus atque extinctio.

de causa census ablationem
incurrant. Concavae vero ob

(Why are the extreme parts
of the body liable to nomae
(eating ulcers), and likewise
the concave parts? It is because
a <i>noma</i> is a form of putrefaction
and a perishing and
extinction of sensation? Now
the extreme parts owing to
the scantiness of the nourishment
they get are easily robbed
of heat, so that for this reason
they incur loss of sensation.
On the other hand the concave
parts owing to the excess of
moist matter that collects in
them, which is the occasion
of their being attacked by
putrefaction). Comp. what was
said above under the head of
“Climate”.</p></div>

<i>Cedrenus</i>, Σύνοψις ἱστορικὴ
(Historical Survey), edit.
J. Goar and H. Fabrot, Paris
1647. fol., p. 266. In Diocletian’s
time when persecutions
of the Christians were general,
a fair and modest maiden was
charged with having spoken
disrespectfully of the gods;
for punishment she was sent
to a brothel with the order
that she must reimburse the
brothel-keeper three shillings
a day. The latter was to make
her serve as a prostitute, and
she was to receive all who
wished to go with her. Account
however was taken of
the fact that she declared <i>she
had an ulcer on her privates</i>,
and this obliged them to wait
till it was cured (προσφασιζομένη
ἕλκος ἔχειν ἐπὶ κρυπτοῦ
τόπου καὶ τούτου ἀπαλλαγὴν
ἐκδέξασθαι) (pretexting she
had an ulcer in a secret place,
and must wait for its removal).
The same story is told by
<i>Palladius</i>, Hist. lausiac. ch.
148., as having happened at
Corinth, who calls the ulcer
an evil-smelling one, that might
easily stir the repugnance of
her visitors against the girl,
(λέγουσα, ὅτι ἕλκος ἔχω τι
εἰς κεκρυμμένον τόπον, ὅπερ
ἐσχάτως ὄζει, καὶ δέδοικα
μὴ εἰς μῖσός μου ἔηθητε τῷ
ἀποτροπαίῳ τοῦ ἕλκους·
ἔνδοτε οὖν μοι ὀλίγας ἡμέρας
καὶ ἐξουσίαν μου ἔχετε καὶ
δωρεάν με ἔχειν,)—(saying “I
have an ulcer in a secret part,
which smells very ill, and I fear
you may come to feel repugnance
towards me owing to
the foulness of the ulcer; grant
me therefore a few days, then
may work your will of me and I
undertake to give myself freely”).
The last sentence shows clearly
that the ulcer was easy to cure.

eccles. bk. VII. chs. 12, 13.</p></div>

(θύμος,—<i>thymus</i>, a reddish
outgrowth, rough, suffused
with blood, not difficult to
remove, occurring chiefly on
the genital organs and anus
and insides of the thighs; but
sometimes on the face too).

should be attached to the fact
that the ancient physicians
recommend as remedies against
ulcers of the nose and mouth
exactly the same means as
they employed in cases of
ulcer of the genitals. Comp.

is interesting that <i>falling way

gives sufferers an apelike
look, ἀλλὰ κἂν ἐξ ὑπερώας

nose separates from the palate,
they get flat-nosed, as they

Abbot Polychronius again
related an incident to us, telling
us how in the Monastery
of Penthula there was a
brother well self-disciplined
and ascetic. But he was sorely
tempted to fornication, and
unable to fight the temptation,
he went forth from the
Monastery and departed to
Jericho to fulfil his desire;
and when he <i>entered into the
common house of fornication,
straightway he became
leprous all over</i>. And when
he saw himself in such a case,
straightway he returned to his
Monastery, blessing God and
saying, “God hath brought
down this disease upon me,
that my soul might be saved”).</p></div>

you will find patients suffering
from pains in the parts surrounding
the bones inclined
to suppose they are suffering
from the bones themselves....
And it is not at all surprising
that pains in the membranes
that lie about the bones being
deep-seated, that is giving a
sensation of being deep-seated
in the body, make patients
imagine it is the bones themselves
that suffer. In fact they
call them generally bone-racking
pains; and they are
set up as a rule after bodily
exercises, but also sometimes
as a consequence of cold or
heat).</p></div>

<i>Natalis Comes</i>, Mythologia
bk. III. p. 383., Deinde
dicta (Cyprus) <em class="gesperrt">Cerastia</em>, ut
inquit Xenagoras in libro
secundo de insulis, quod illam
homines habitarent, <em class="gesperrt">qui
multos tumores, tanquam

viderentur, cum cornua κέρατα
dicta sint a Graecis et κεράσται
cornuti. (Then it (Cyprus) was
also named <i>Cerastia</i>, as Xenagoras
says in his second Book
“On Islands”, because its
inhabitants <i>often had protuberances
that looked like
horns on their heads</i>, for
horns are called κέρατα in
Greek, and those having horns
κεράσται. Comp. <i>Stephanus</i>,
De urbibus, under word
Κύπρος, and Σφήκεια. <i>Tzetzes</i>,
in Lycophron. Cassandr. 474.
p. 173., ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ καὶ
Κεραστία, ὡς μὲν Ἀνδροκλῆς
ἐν τῷ περὶ Κύπρου λέγει,
διὰ τὸ <em class="gesperrt">ἐνοικῆσαι αὐτῇ

ὡς δὲ Ξεναγόρας

ἔχειν πολλὰς ἐξοχὰς</em>,
ἃς κέρατα καλοῦσι, Κεραστία
ὠνομάσθη. (And it was also
called Κεραστία, according to
Androcles in his Book “On
Cyprus”, <i>because men lived
in it who had horns</i>; but
according to Xenagoras in his
“On Islands”, because they
had many protuberances, which
they call horns, for this reason
it was named Κεραστία). Even
supposing the etymology to be
a fable, is the fact therefore
on which it was based bound
to be mythical too? Again
<i>Pollux</i>, Onomast. bk. IV. ch.
25., says, Κέρατα, ἐν τῷ
τόπῳ τῶν κεράτων περὶ τὸ
μέτωπου <em class="gesperrt">πωρώδεις ἐκφύσης</em>, (horns,—<i>a sort of
callous outgrowths</i> at the
place where horns grow on
the forehead). The words
succeeding περὶ τὸ δέρμα (on
the skin) are no doubt more
appropriately taken with ἕρπης
(creeping eruption) that comes
next after them. In <i>Sextus
Placitus Papyriensis</i>, ch. XI.
5. we read: Elephantis stercus
illitum omnes tumores emendat,
et <i>duritias, quae in fronte
nascuntur</i>, mire tollit, (Elephant’s
dung rubbed on cures
all swellings, and removes in
a wonderful way the <i>callosities
that grow on the forehead</i>),
but this really and truly can
only be held applicable to
cutaneous tubercles.)</p>
